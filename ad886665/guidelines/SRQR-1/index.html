<p><strong>Concise description of the nature and topic of the study. Identifying the study as qualitative or indicating the approach (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">ethnography</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>) or data collection methods (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span>) is recommended.</strong></p>
<p>The authors should provide a title that clearly conveys the topic of the study. We suggest that the title indicate that the study is qualitative or include a commonly used term that identifies the approach (e.g., ethnographic study, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>) or data collection methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups, observations). This allows readers and reviewers to quickly identify the type of study.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of key elements of the study using the abstract format of the intended publication; typically includes background, purpose, methods, results, and conclusions.</strong></p>
<p>A reader should be able to read the abstract independent of the manuscript and get a sense of the background, purpose, methods, main results and implications that will be described in greater detail in the manuscript. The information presented in the abstract should be consistent with the information presented in the full text.</p>
<p>The abstract’s structure typically needs to conform to journal guidelines, but authors should attempt to include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Background about the problem or phenomenon of interest</p></li>
<li><p>Description of the study purpose or research question;</p></li>
<li><p>Methods, including the approach or perspective (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">general inductive</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>), <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> (<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem6" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">setting</span>, time period), <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span> (number and key characteristics of participants, events, documents), data collection strategies (e g., observation, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span>) and data analysis techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Description of main findings (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">inferences</span>) related to the study purpose and/or research question</p></li>
<li><p>Study implications</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases the journal’s structured abstract format aligns more with <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem10" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span> paradigms and quantitative approaches than with qualitative traditions, so translation may be necessary. For example, what might be labelled “findings” in many qualitative research traditions could be reported as “results” in the abstract.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Although academic centers rely on assessments from medical trainees regarding the effectiveness of their faculty as teachers, little is known about how trainees conceptualize and approach their role as assessors of their clinical supervisors</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong>: In 2010, using a <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem16" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span> approach, five <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span> interviews were conducted with 19 residents from an internal medicine residency program. A constant comparative analysis of emergent <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> was conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.</p>

<p><strong>Description and significance of the problem/phenomenon studied; review of relevant theory and empirical work; problem statement.</strong></p>
<p>The problem formulation typically appears in the introduction and describes the theoretical and/or practical issues or concerns that make the study necessary. It should provide an overview of what is known about the problem, highlight gaps in current knowledge (the problem statement), and define the scope of the research problem or phenomena addressed in the study (what will and will not be included). It should include a review of theoretical and/or empirical work directly relevant to the problem or phenomena studied. The problem formulation should be described in a way that suggests the need for a qualitative approach (e.g., to elucidate poorly defined or previously unexplored <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem12" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructs</span>, to generate theories or to develop causal explanations connecting processes and outcomes, to understand phenomena as they naturally occur and the role of <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span>, to explore problems involving high complexity, to gain insight into participants’ perspectives when such insight is lacking).</p>

<p>Regulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? …. In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> of real clinical learning situations.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the study and specific objectives or questions</strong></p>
<p>In qualitative research, as in all types of research, the authors should include a statement of study intent. This statement can be framed as one or more research questions, purposes, goals, or objectives. Qualitative studies often explore “how” and “why” questions related to a social or human problems or phenomenon, and they are designed to enhance readers’ understanding of a problem or phenomenon. By clearly stating the purpose of the study, authors set readers’ expectations for the methods, findings and discussion sections of the manuscript.</p>

<p>The research paradigm is the set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem10" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem11" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem16" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem17" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span>, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem11" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem16" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span>/<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem17" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span> paradigm. We recommend identifying the research paradigm so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem10" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem11" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span>) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem16" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span>/<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem17" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span>). The paradigm has implications for the study design, approach, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Qualitative research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., qualitative content analysis, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">general inductive</span> approach) and specific (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">ethnography</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>, phenomenography). Since the research paradigm does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the approach should also be clearly defined. Stating the approach provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research approach to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected approach. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) The researcher should explain why the selected approach is appropriate for the research question, and provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the approach as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers’ characteristics that may influence the research, including personal attributes, qualifications/experience, relationship with participants, assumptions, and/or presuppositions; potential or actual interaction between researchers’ characteristics and the research questions, approach, methods, results and/or transferability.</strong></p>
<p>Reflexivity refers to intentional, systematic consideration of the potential or actual effects of the researcher(s) on all aspects of the study process. In <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem10" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span> and <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem11" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span> paradigms, personal characteristics and perspectives of researchers might be viewed as biases that limit the credibility of study findings, while in <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem16" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem17" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span> paradigms the characteristics and perspectives of the researchers are important contextual factors that are an accepted part of the study design, data collection, and data analysis. These characteristics and perspectives may explain how the researcher(s) obtained access to the site or participants included in the study or may add valuable insight during data analysis.</p>
<p>To demonstrate reflexivity, authors should describe important personal characteristics and perspectives of members of the research team that may influence design, data collection, and data analysis. Relevant personal characteristics might include cultural background, occupation, experience, training, position/ power dynamics, gender, race/ethnicity, and sponsoring institution. Authors should also describe the perspectives, assumptions, prior knowledge, preliminary hypotheses, and/or motives (the “stance”) of the members of the research team.</p>
<p>Authors also should describe the researchers’ relationships to participants in the study and what decisions were made in light of these relationships. For example, were any members of the research team part of the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span> of potential participants in the study? Do any members of the team teach, supervise, or have any authority over participants in the study? If so, how do these characteristics influence choices about their roles in data collection and analysis? For observational research (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">ethnography</span>), it is also important to identify the role of the researcher along a spectrum from passive observer (no involvement in the activity studied) to participant-observer (ranging from some limited involvement in the activity to full involvement).</p>
<p>There is no expectation that the study could be precisely replicated; these characteristics and perspectives of the researcher should not be mentioned in the limitation section. (See also Item 14.)</p>

<p><strong>How and why research participants, documents, or events were selected; criteria for deciding when no further sampling was necessary (e.g., sampling saturation); rationale.</strong></p>
<p>The authors should describe how and why research participants, documents, and/or events were selected for inclusion in (and, if appropriate, exclusion from) the study, along with a justification for this strategy. We recommend that authors describe the sampling strategy rather than simply labeling the strategy (e.g., “purposive” or “snowball”), since such labels do not have a universally accepted definition and, more importantly, since procedures tend to be study- specific. Several sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of purposeful (or purposive) sampling. Purposeful sampling means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question. Other sampling techniques, such as theoretical sampling (seeking examples of theoretical <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem12" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructs</span>), snowball sampling (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and convenience sampling (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.</p>
<p>Although investigators often do not determine <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span> size a priori in qualitative research, they should nonetheless describe how they established the final <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span> size. When appropriate (e.g., when a flexible sampling strategy was used), they should explain the criteria used to decide when no further sampling was necessary. If data collection ends at the point when the researchers determine that “saturation” has been reached, then the specific criteria used to define saturation should be described.</p>
<p>Procedures used to recruit participants should also be described, including who was involved in recruitment, what their relationship was to participants, how and when recruitment occurred, and why these procedures were selected. (See also Item 6)</p>

<p><strong>Documentation of approval by an appropriate ethics review board and participant consent, or explanation for lack thereof; other confidentiality and data security issues.</strong></p>
<p>Qualitative research often involves interaction between researchers and research participants. Correspondingly, researchers should ensure that participants are fully aware of their participation in a research study, the risks and benefits associated with the study, the steps and precautions the researchers will take to minimize risks, such as loss of privacy and confidentiality, and how the researchers plan to use the data. Authors should report approval for the study from an appropriate institutional review board for research associated with human subjects. They should describe procedures used to protect participants, including data collection (e.g., recruitment and informed consent) analysis (e.g., data security and integrity) and reporting of findings (e.g., anonymization of excerpts). If researchers provided compensation or offered incentives to facilitate participation, this should be reported.</p>

<p><strong>Types of data collected; details of data collection procedures including (as appropriate) start and stop dates of data collection and analysis, iterative process, triangulation of sources/methods, and modification of procedures in response to evolving study findings; rationale.</strong></p>
<p>Qualitative research encompasses an array of data collection methods appropriate for various paradigms and approaches, including (but not limited to) interviews, focus groups, observations (direct or indirect via video), and review of written text, photographs, and other documents or materials. Researchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). (See Item 11 for triangulation.) Given this diversity of methods, authors should describe in detail their data collection design and method(s) and justify them in relation to the research question(s), paradigm, approach, and other methods. Methods used to decide when to end data collection should also be described (see Item 8).</p>
<p>Qualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages, and thus authors must clearly describe the iterative process of data collection and analysis. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives. If such changes occur during the research process, authors should describe how and why study procedures changed in response to evolving study findings.</p>
<p>The study period (start and end dates for data collection and analysis) should be identified so that readers can place the study in temporal <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> and identify factors not mentioned by the authors that might affect findings, interpretation, and implications. (See Item 8 for ending data collection.)</p>
<p>Authors should describe important characteristics of the individuals conducting interviews, observations or focus groups, and methods used to train these individuals. This information clarifies the relationship between the individuals involved in data collection and the participants in the research and also explains what efforts were made to ensure consistency in the data collection process (See Items 6 and 15.)</p>

<p><strong>Number and relevant characteristics of participants, documents, or events included in the study; level of participation.</strong></p>
<p>Authors should describe the participants, documents, or events included in the study (the units of study). The sampling item (Item 8) describes the target or ideal participants, documents, or events selected for the study. By contrast, Item 12 focuses on description of the actual participants, documents or events included in the study. Authors should describe how the actual participants, documents, or events differ from the targeted <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span>, why these differences may have occurred, and how this might affect the findings.</p>
<p>Authors should describe characteristics of the participants, documents or events that are relevant to the study purpose and research question(s).1 For participants, this might include age, gender, profession, institution, year of training, or relationship to the researcher and/or other participants in the study. For documents, this might include the source, intended audience, date, or type of document. For events, this might include the location, date(s), length, characteristics of attendees or participants in the event, or mood or emotional climate. If the degree of participation varied among individuals (e.g., multiple occasions; interviews and observations), the authors should describe different levels of participation. For example, if some participants were observed and interviewed and others only interviewed, or if some participants completed multiple interviews and others completed a single <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span>, these variations should be explained. Authors should also explain the reasons for these differences (i.e., the researchers’ choice or the participants’ preferences) and how these different levels of participation were taken into account in the analysis. Authors should also include the dates or timeframe for participation.</p>
<p>This information about participants could appear in the Methods section as part of the description of the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span>, or at the beginning of the Results section to provide <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> for the findings presented.</p>

<p><strong>Methods for processing data prior to and during analysis, including transcription, data entry, data management and security, verification of data integrity, data coding and anonymization / de-identification of excerpts.</strong></p>
<p>Authors should describe the ways in which data are prepared for analysis and managed throughout the analysis process. These activities might include transcription, coding, data entry, and organization of data. When processing audio or video recordings, relevant details might include indication of verbatim transcription of dialogue, additional notes to capture non- verbal information (especially for group interviews or focus groups), and annotations to indicate vocal inflections and utterances, as appropriate for the analytic approach. Authors should also describe procedures used to check transcripts for accuracy.</p>
<p>Authors should describe the processes used to organize, compile, and categorize data (e.g., field notes, transcripts, documents, photographs, artifacts) for analysis.</p>
<p>Authors should describe procedures used to maintain data security and protect the privacy of participants, as specified in the human subjects protocols. For example, if data are anonymized, the authors should explain how and at what point in the process this occurred. Authors may choose to use anonymous labels or identifiers to represent quotes or excerpts from unique participants, documents or events, in order to reflect the variety of sources from which such data were derived.</p>

<p>Techniques used for data analysis will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or data collection methods selected by the researchers. Correspondingly, authors should be as transparent as possible about the analytic process so that readers can follow the logic of inquiry from the research question(s) to the analysis and findings. For example, this description may involve characterizing the processes and decisions made for initial classification or segmentation of data, pattern identification and description, and/or development of in-depth interpretations.1 If the researchers used an approach that has a well-defined process for data analysis (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>, discourse analysis, phenomenography), the authors should cite the guiding literature and describe their processes in sufficient detail so readers can judge the extent to which the processes align with the guiding approach. If modification to or deviations from the guiding approach occurred, the authors should explain and justify these modifications.</p>
<p>Authors should specify the unit of analysis.1 In qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">inferences</span> drawn from the data.</p>
<p>Authors should explain the rationale underlying different decisions made throughout the data analysis process to provide as much transparency as possible. In some approaches researchers use memoing or bracketing to make their reflections, interpretations, and links among passages explicit and more transparent to others. In some types of analysis, participants’ perspectives or observations that contrast or deviate from the concepts or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> identified by the researchers are an important part of the analysis. In such cases, the authors must describe how these discrepancies were handled during the analysis.</p>
<p>During the analysis process, researchers may draw upon a theoretical perspective or framework, which may have been identified early in the conception of the study or may be identified by the researchers after reviewing some or all of their data. Either way, the authors should describe theoretical or other influences on their analysis scheme or categories if they exist. Sometimes these are referred to as “sensitizing concepts” to acknowledge that the approach is inductive, but with influence from relevant theory, models, or organizational schemes. Alternatively, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> may be developed from the data with no external influences.</p>
<p>Authors should describe which members of the research team are involved in data analysis and what perspective(s) they bring to the analysis. Authors should also indicate if any software was used to assist with data analysis and how it was used (e.g., used to apply codes after the final coding scheme was developed; to extract coded passages for further synthesis and identification of <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span>; or to identify passages with key words). Simply stating that software was used is insufficient.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques to enhance trustworthiness and credibility of data analysis,(e.g., member checking, triangulation, audit trail); rationale.</strong></p>
<p>Authors should describe methods used to ensure trustworthiness and credibility throughout the data collection and analysis process. Such methods will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or methods used. Correspondingly, the authors should explain their choice of techniques and why these are appropriate for the particular study.</p>
<p>Commonly used techniques to enhance trustworthiness include: member checking; triangulation of data sources, methods, and/or researchers; creation of an explicit audit trail; and immersion in the site of data collection for an extended period of time (especially for research in which an observer’s presence is likely to disrupt the phenomenon under investigation). Member checking involves sharing findings, such as descriptions of key phenomena, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span>, or an explanatory model, with participants and asking them to verify the accuracy or resonance with their perspectives. Triangulation involves using more than one data source, method, or researcher to add diverse perspectives on the findings of the study and, in some approaches, to test the transferability or generalizability of a model. An audit trail involves careful documentation of all decisions made throughout the study, from initial conceptualization to study design, sampling, analysis, and reporting, to provide transparency and to enable an external researcher to review all the steps involved in the study.</p>

Moreover, this enabled us to better explore the evolution over time, given that the focus groups included participants at different stages of their study: before clerkships (year 4, undergraduate), during clerkships (year 6, undergraduate), after clerkships (year 7, undergraduate) and postgraduate (general practice trainees, and supervising specialists and GPs; Table 1).</p>

<p><strong>Main findings (e.g., interpretations, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">inferences</span>, and <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span>); might include development of a theory or model, or integration with prior research or theory.</strong></p>
<p>In qualitative research the distinction between results and discussion tends to blur because analysis often involves interpretation, inference, and synthesis. Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16-19 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.</p>
<p>Authors should identify the main analytic findings (e.g., interpretations, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">inferences</span>, narratives, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span>, models). The nature of these findings and how they are reported will depend on the approach and methodology selected and thus should be in alignment with the approach and methods.</p>
<p>In most cases, the authors should report a synthesis of their data along with specific quotes, examples, or illustrations derived from their data. Authors might also report frequency, variety, representativeness, counter-examples, concrete details, contextualization, conditions, and qualifications related to their findings. Frequency counts (e.g., the frequency of specific <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> or codes) play a limited role in qualitative research, and need not be reported unless they play a meaningful role in interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>Findings might also include integration with prior literature or theory and/or the development of a theory, model or meta-narrative. Judicious use of tables and figures can help communicate such findings.</p>

<p>We identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Because our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Their three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance). In each of these areas, medical enculturation was achieved by two overlapping processes, ‘absorption’ and ‘assimilation’, each of which may have distinct implications for postgraduate medical education.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate analytic findings.</strong></p>
<p>The authors should provide evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate the more general and abstract concepts or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">inferences</span> they present as findings. Such evidence is typically de-identified to protect the privacy of study participants, settings, and/or institutions. The evidence may be presented in a variety of ways such as in a table or figure, incorporated into a narrative description of findings, as a stand-alone narrative, or in text blocks embedded in the manuscript text. If word limits or media limitations (e.g.. video) limit the authors’ ability to provide sufficient representation of supporting data, an appendix, supplemental material, or web-based repository could be used to provide access to additional data.</p>

<p>We identified five interruption types: (1) probing for further data, (2) prompting for expected sequence, (3) teaching around the case, (4) thinking out loud, and (5) providing direction (see Table 1). Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).</p>

<p><strong>Short summary of main findings, explanation of how findings and conclusions connect to, support, elaborate on, or challenge conclusions of earlier scholarship; discussion of scope of application/generalizability; identification of unique contribution(s) to scholarship in a discipline or field.</strong></p>
<p>The authors should begin the Discussion with a short summary of the main findings. The short summary reminds readers of the main findings and may help them assess whether the subsequent interpretation and implications formulated by the authors are supported by the findings.</p>
<p>The authors’ description of their findings or results should include some interpretation of the data in the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> of previous findings, experiences, theory, or a guiding paradigm or approach. The discussion provides authors an opportunity to elaborate on their findings in relation to their research question(s) and study purpose(s); connect their findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks; and discuss implications. The authors should explicitly describe how their findings contribute to or advance the field. Implications may include transferability, or specifying the appropriate scope for generalization of the findings beyond the study (e.g., to other settings, populations, time periods, circumstances).</p>

<p>This study contributes to the understanding and discussion of the complexity of involving patients in healthcare education. It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs. What is not known, however, is whether perceptions are also affected by type of health profession and the students’ different orientation towards logics of care and science, and issues of authority and power relations.</p>

<p><strong>Trustworthiness and limitations of findings</strong></p>
<p>Authors should describe techniques used to ensure trustworthiness in the Methods section of the manuscript. In the Discussion, authors should identify problems or gaps in their efforts to ensure trustworthiness and the potential implications. For example, if researchers intended to <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span> individuals with certain characteristics, or who might offer different perspectives, but were unsuccessful in recruiting any willing participants, they should explain this issue and describe possible consequences for transferability. (See also Item 18.)</p>
<p>All research paradigms and approaches have strengths and weaknesses, and authors should explicitly discuss how the paradigm, approach, and methods they used will influence the situations to which their findings may reasonably apply. (See also Item 18.) In addition, they should explain how specific decisions or events in the conduct of the study strengthen or weaken the rigor of their findings.</p>

<p>The study has several limitations. One is that the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span> method reveals students’ perceptions rather than their actual behaviors. Observations of the patient-led teaching encounter may have illuminated an understanding of the relationship between patient instructors and medical students. Another limitation is that the PI-led teaching is optional rather than mandatory, which may have influenced students’ attitudes in a positive direction. Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span>. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data.</p>
