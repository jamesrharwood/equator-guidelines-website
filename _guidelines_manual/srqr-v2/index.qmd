The SRQR <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#reportingGuidelines" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">reporting guideline</span> helps authors write qualitative research articles that can be understood and used by <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#researchConsumers" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">everyone</span>. This page summarises the reporting guideline, how and when it can be used, how it was made, and how to cite it. Each guideline item links to more information, examples, and relevant training.

## How to use this reporting guideline

You can use <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#reportingGuidelines" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">reporting guidelines</span> throughout your research process. 

* When writing: Consider using a [writing guide](#downloads) to draft your manuscript or protocol.
* After writing: Complete a [checklist](#downloads) and include it with your journal submission.
* To learn: Consult the [guidance](#summary) whenever you need it.

Please [cite](#how-to-cite) SRQR, however you use it.

## Item order and priority

SRQR does not prescribe order nor structure. Items can be reordered or reported in different sections. For example, some authors may prefer to include some methods items (e.g. Units of Study) in their Results section. Others may call their Results section _Findings_, or have a completely different manuscript structure. 
You should include items in the article body when possible, or in tables, figures, or supplements if necessary ([see FAQs]()). Although all items should be reported, you should prioritize items most relevant to your study, findings, context, and readership.

## How this reporting guideline was made

SRQR was made through a rigorous, evidence based process and originally published as an [academic article](). The UK EQUATOR Centre then worked with SRQR's developers to make it easier to use by clarifying language, adding definitions, examples, extra information and resources. Although worded differently, the guidance on this website is conceptually the same as the original publication and can be used interchangeably. Read more about [SRQR's development]() in the FAQ.

## How to cite this reporting guideline {#how-to-cite}

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

If you used the SRQR reporting guideline, writing guide, or checklist to write a publication, please state so in your methods section so that other authors can find these resources too. E.g.,

We like publishing transparent research because we think it's more likely to be used and cited. That's why we ask authors to use reporting guidelines.
