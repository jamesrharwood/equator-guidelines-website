## What reporting guidelines are and why you should use them

### Recommendations to help describe your work clearly

Your research will be used by people from different disciplines and backgrounds for decades to come. Reporting guidelines list the information you should describe so that _everyone_ can understand, replicate, and synthesise your work. 

Reporting guidelines make writing research easier, and transparent research leads to better patient outcomes.
<!-- #ASK: It is not just about patient outcomes. Should we also mention more usable research results? -->
