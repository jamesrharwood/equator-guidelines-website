## Example{#sec-abstract-3}

> **Purpose**: Although academic centers rely on assessments from medical trainees regarding the effectiveness of their faculty as teachers, little is known about how trainees conceptualize and <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> their role as assessors of their clinical supervisors<br>**Method**: In 2010, using a constructivist <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>, five focus group interviews were conducted with 19 residents from an internal medicine residency program. A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.<br>**Results**: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.<br>**Conclusions**: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.

<!-- #TODO: bad examples -->

## Use the format of your intended journal{#sec-abstract-4}

Some journals require abstracts to have subheadings, others don't. In some cases the journal's structured abstract format aligns more with positivist paradigms and quantitative approaches than with qualitative traditions, so translation may be necessary. For example, what might be labelled "Findings" in many qualitative research traditions could be reported as "Results" in the abstract. Similarly, "Design" might be labelled as "<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">Approach</span>" or "Methodology" for a qualitative study.

## Example{#sec-problem-formulation-3}

> Regulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? .... In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the context of real clinical learning situations.

## Why readers need this information{#sec-qualitative-approach-2}

Identifying the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">research paradigm</span> helps readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>, methods, and techniques to ensure rigour and trustworthiness.

Since the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">research paradigm</span> does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> should also be clearly defined. Stating the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10).

## Examples{#sec-qualitative-approach-3}

> The study was performed from a constructivist point of view using an interpretative phenomenological epistemology. Based on the notion that social phenomena are constructed by the communal making of meaning about the underlying phenomena, we aimed to construct insightful accounts of lead consultants’ approaches to educational change, rather than to identify the ‘true’ nature of these approaches. Because the management of change by lead consultants is an under-researched area, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study...

> Given the relative dearth of explanatory theories about factors affecting medical students’ emotional reactions, we chose to develop one by applying methods associated with <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>, specifically constant comparative analysis, to qualitative data obtained from learning logs and interviews. Our <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> was constructivist, deliberately using researchers’ own experiences and acquired knowledge to enhance theoretical sensitivity and enrich theory development.

Describe the perspectives, assumptions, prior knowledge, preliminary hypotheses, and/or motives (the "stance") of the members of the research team.

Describe the researchers’ relationships to participants in the study and what decisions were made in light of these relationships.^[For example, were any members of the research team part of the sample of potential participants in the study?

## Why readers need this information{#sec-researcher-characteristics-and-reflexivity-2}

In positivist and post-positivist paradigms, personal characteristics and perspectives of researchers might be viewed as biases that limit the credibility of study findings, while in constructivist or interpretivist paradigms the characteristics and perspectives of the researchers are important contextual factors that are an accepted part of the study design, data collection, and data analysis. These characteristics and perspectives may explain how the researcher(s) obtained access to the site or participants included in the study or may add valuable insight during data analysis.

> We conducted the study among hospital-based clinical teachers of students in years 4 to 6 of a six-year undergraduate medical program at Maastricht University Medical School. Years 4 to 6 are devoted to clerkships in the academic hospital and affiliated regional hospitals. Rotations differ in duration depending on the type of rotation and the discipline, and the sequence of rotations differs among students. During rotations, students spend time in the wards, the outpatient clinics, and the accident and emergency department. Clerkships in years 4 and 5 last between 4 and 10 weeks (“regular clerkship”), whereas students in year 6 undertake an 18-week “senior clerkship” in a discipline of their choice.

This information helps readers understand the source of data / findings so they can consider the boundaries of the study and the relevance to their own context. It also gives readers insight into the researchers' decisions, which can be important for critical appraisal.

## Examples{#sec-sampling-strategy-3}

> As students’ perceptions were previously shown to be related to gender, age, prior experience and place of attachment,[REF] we purposely selected respondents with different backgrounds. This sampling strategy led to the diversity of gender, age, prior patient experience and place of attachment shown in Table 1.

> Purposive sampling was directed towards achieving maximum variation in age and specialty, using a snowball approach (‘a non-probabilistic form of sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample’).[REF ]

> Potential participants were all medical students in Years 1 and 2 at the University of Toronto in 2004. Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e-mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group). There were no exclusion criteria and we accepted the first 15 students from each class who volunteered.

## Why readers need this information{#sec-ethics-2}

Journals will require an ethical approval statement.

Qualitative research often involves interaction between researchers and research participants. Correspondingly, researchers should ensure that participants are fully aware of their participation in a research study, the risks and benefits associated with the study, the steps and precautions the researchers will take to minimize risks, such as loss of privacy and confidentiality, and how the researchers plan to use the data.

<!-- #TODO: Why? doesn't justify why a reader needs this info. -->

## Examples{#sec-ethics-3}

> Ethical approval was granted by the University of Otago and student participants were invited to attend each focus group discussion by the university representatives of New Zealand Medical Students Association (NZMSA). Usually, a key concern when collecting data from students is that students may feel vulnerable when sharing their experiences with academic staff during a focus group discussion. However, this potential harm was removed as each group discussion was facilitated by a fellow student, the discussions were transcribed by a professional transcribing service, and only the primary researchers [Names] had access to the raw data.

> To facilitate the discussion and to maintain consistency over different sets of discussions, key trigger questions were devised prior to the discussion. The opening trigger question was: ‘Thinking back to some of your best clinical learning placements in 4th and 5th year. What was it about those clinical placements that provided good opportunities for learning?’

> Interviews included discussion of the expectations, processes and consequences of AEE [authentic early experiences]. The interview schedule was derived following identification of questions that could not be fully answered in a systematic review of previous empirical or theoretical literature. It comprised a sequence of topic areas including experiences in action, and areas of frustration in Medical Education such as the learning of content knowledge, achieving functional knowledge, and transfer of knowledge.[REF]... Interested readers can request a copy of the schedules from the corresponding author. Interviews lasted between 20 and 90 min. and discussion groups between 60 and 90 min. All interviews and discussion groups were conducted in private rooms at the participant’s workplace—the medical school for students and faculty, and individual places of work for workplace supervisors (except for one who chose to be interviewed at the medical school). All data were audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim.

Describe your analytic process as transparently as possible.^[E.g., characterize the processes and decisions made for initial classification or segmentation of data, pattern identification and description, and/or development of in-depth interpretations.]

If you used an approach that has a well-defined process for data analysis (e.g., grounded theory, discourse analysis, phenomenography):

* cite the guiding literature

* describe your processes in sufficient detail so readers can judge the extent to which your processes align with the guiding approach.

* If you modified or deviated from the guiding approach, explain and justify these modifications.

Specify the unit of analysis.^[In qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.]

Explain the rationale underlying different decisions made throughout the data analysis process to provide as much transparency as possible.^[In some approaches researchers use memoing or bracketing to make their reflections, interpretations, and links among passages explicit and more transparent to others.]

If observations that contrast or deviate from identified concepts or themes were important to your analysis, describe how these discrepancies were handled during the analysis.

If you drew upon a theoretical perspective or framework during analysis, describe theoretical or other influences on your analysis scheme or categories if they exist. If you identified a theoretical perspective or framework early in the conception of the study or after reviewing some or all of their data, consider referring to these as “sensitizing concepts” to acknowledge that the approach is inductive, but with influence from relevant theory, models, or organizational schemes. Alternatively, explain that themes were developed from the data with no external influences.

Describe which members of the research team are involved in data analysis and what perspective(s) they bring to the analysis.

If software was used to assist with data analysis^[e.g., used to apply codes after the final coding scheme was developed; to extract coded passages for further synthesis and identification of themes; or to identify passages with key words], describe how it was used. Simply stating that software was used is insufficient.

Correspondingly, authors should be as transparent as possible about the analytic process so that readers can follow the logic of inquiry from the research question(s) to the analysis and findings.

## Examples{#sec-data-analysis-3}

>...we brought sensitizing concepts to the analysis while we conducted an open, inductive analysis.[REF]In this case the sensitizing concepts arose, a priori to analysis, from a framework derived from the literature [REF] (as described above), in which participants’ motivations to act are based on principles of professionalism, internal affect, or potential implications of their actions.[REF]

> Through an iterative process of listening, discussing, and relistening, the team identified and consensually validated emerging themes[REF] and appended segments of dialogue supporting the proposed themes. Recruitment stopped when saturation was reached (no new themes were identified). The team systematically reviewed the themes and sorted them into content domains. The team used an analytic matrix to identify patterns and connections amongst the domains. Two of us not involved in the qualitative coding process (R.E., M.K.) audited the analytic matrix, choice of quotes, and thematic analysis.

> The analysis started after the first interview. All data were analyzed with the aid of the audio- coding facility of the NVivo 8: QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Vic, Australia programme. First, [name] and [name] coded independently from one another, making sure to stay semantically close to the participants’ wording. Then we discussed these open codes and defined axial codes.[REF] New insights about the impact of CST were written down in memos.

> Videotapes were analysed using immersion/crystallisation methods of qualitative data analysis.[REF] With no pre-existing framework developed in advance for analysis, an inductive approach was used to discover patterns of NVB in the data. A team of six researchers met weekly for 18 months to view videos together. Using a consensus-building approach based on a combination of field notes, ‘opportunistic’ interviews with the participants, and repeated viewing of the same material, sometimes many months apart, we eventually achieved consensus on verbal, non-verbal, and physical themes and patterns observed in the data. Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit,’ we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.

> All transcripts were coded thematically by four of the five authors, who met regularly to identify areas of convergence until full agreement was reached. One of the interviewers (P.M.) maintained an audit trail to track the team’s developing thinking. A process of dialectical empiricism[REF] was used to categorise the emergent themes into more abstract concepts...

Describe methods used to ensure trustworthiness and credibility throughout the data collection and analysis process. (See footnote on commonly used techniques^[Techniques to enhance trustworthiness will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or methods used. Commonly used techniques include: member checking; triangulation of data sources, methods, and/or researchers; creation of an explicit audit trail; and immersion in the site of data collection for an extended period of time (especially for research in which an observer's presence is likely to disrupt the phenomenon under investigation). Member checking involves sharing findings, such as descriptions of key phenomena, themes, or an explanatory model, with participants and asking them to verify the accuracy or resonance with their perspectives. Triangulation involves using more than one data source, method, or researcher to add diverse perspectives on the findings of the study and, in some approaches, to test the transferability or generalizability of a model. An audit trail involves careful documentation of all decisions made throughout the study, from initial conceptualization to study design, sampling, analysis, and reporting, to provide transparency and to enable an external researcher to review all the steps involved in the study.]).

Member checking

Triangulation of data types and data sources

> The interview data were triangulated with the data of 11 student and supervisor focus groups of a previous study, and more specifically, with those data that concern in particular the influence of CST [Communication Skills Training] on the development of patient-centredness.... Triangulation with the focus group data allowed us to broaden the in-depth information from the interviews in the analysis and to ‘share and compare’ this with information from students and doctors with varying levels of CST (no, limited, full programme) and from two universities (Universities of Antwerp and Ghent). Moreover, this enabled us to better explore the evolution over time, given that the focus groups included participants at different stages of their study: before clerkships (year 4, undergraduate), during clerkships (year 6, undergraduate), after clerkships (year 7, undergraduate) and postgraduate (general practice trainees, and supervising specialists and GPs; Table 1).

> Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit’, we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.

Triangulation of Researchers + Audit trail

> To ensure rigor and increase authenticity in our methodology, we used two kinds of triangulation—investigator triangulation and data triangulation.[REF] We sought analytical rigor using an audit trail and multiple coders; our coding team included an experienced clinician (M.G.) as well as a nonclinician with expertise in medical communication and team dynamics (L.L.).

## Examples{#sec-synthesis-and-interpretation-3}

> We identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.

> Because our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.

> Their three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance). In each of these areas, medical enculturation was achieved by two overlapping processes, ‘absorption’ and ‘assimilation’, each of which may have distinct implications for postgraduate medical education.

Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).

## Why readers need this information{#sec-limitations-2}

All research has limitations. Discussing them will help readers consider the relevance to their context and the resonance with their own experience or observations (or lack of resonance and why that might be). If you don't address limitations, editors and peer reviewers may ask you about them which will delay publication.

## Example{#sec-limitations-3}

> The study has several limitations. One is that the focus group interview method reveals students’ perceptions rather than their actual behaviors. Observations of the patient-led teaching encounter may have illuminated an understanding of the relationship between patient instructors and medical students. Another limitation is that the PI-led teaching is optional rather than mandatory, which may have influenced students’ attitudes in a positive direction. Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our sample. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data.

["Many factors, including professional and personal relationships and activities, can influence the design, conduct, and reporting of the clinical science that informs health care decision. The potential for conflict of interest exists when these relationships and activities may bias judgment (1). Many stakeholders— editors, peer reviewers, clinicians, educators, policymakers, patients, and the public—rely on the disclosure of authors' relationships and activities to inform their assessments. Trust in the transparency, consistency, and completeness of these disclosures is essential." - [ICMJE](https://www.icmje.org/news-and-editorials/proposed-disclosure-form-editorial.pdf)]{.added}
