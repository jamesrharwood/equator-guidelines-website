<button type="button" class="btn-close text-reset" data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
</div>
<div class="offcanvas-body">
<div>A term drawn from quantitative research, bias technically means a systematic error, where a particular research finding deviates from a 'true' finding. This might come about through errors in the manner of interviewing, or by errors in sampling. In qualitative research this is a problematic concept, since by definition the qualitative researcher is part of the process, and all researchers are different. This human factor has been said to be both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of qualitative method. What can be done in commercial qualitative research, however, is to minimise obvious and avoidable sources of bias, for example by not confining all the fieldwork to one social group or geographic location, by taking steps to recognise the personal views of the researcher, (using techniques such as bracketing), and by working in teams.</div>

<button type="button" class="btn-close text-reset" data-bs-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
</div>
<div class="offcanvas-body">
<div>Several sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of *purposeful* (or *purposive*) sampling. 

*Purposeful sampling* means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question. 

Other sampling techniques, such as *theoretical sampling* (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), *snowball sampling* (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and *convenience sampling* (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.

<div>A qualitative “approach” is a general way of thinking about conducting qualitative research.

<div>In qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.
