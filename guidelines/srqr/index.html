<section>
<p>Use SRQR to confidently describe qualitative research. SRQR doesn’t tell you how to <em>do</em> research, but will help you explain your work clearly so that others can find, understand, and use it. Developed by experienced researchers using a thorough process, SRQR is endorsed by hundreds of journals. <!--
Although there is much debate about standards for methodological rigor in qualitative research,13,14,18–20 there is widespread agreement about the need for clear and complete reporting.14,21,22 Optimal reporting would enable editors, reviewers, other researchers, and practitioners to critically appraise qualitative studies and apply and synthesize the results. One important step in improving the quality of reporting is to formulate and define clear reporting standards. * Could use this as a before / after quote?

‘Reporting guidelines help me structure my drafts and develop a strong foundation and habits as I write. I use them when teaching and hope that my students continue to use them.’

 As a junior scientist it gives me conﬁdence to request the reporting of a certain piece of information knowing I have the backing of STROBE’’ (group 3).

A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.<br><strong>Results</strong>: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.<br><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.</p>

<p>Some journals require abstracts to have subheadings, others don’t. In some cases the journal’s structured abstract format aligns more with positivist paradigms and quantitative approaches than with qualitative traditions, so translation may be necessary. For example, what might be labelled “Findings” in many qualitative research traditions could be reported as “Results” in the abstract. Similarly, “Design” might be labelled as “<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">Approach</span>” or “Methodology” for a qualitative study.</p>

<p>Regulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? …. In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the context of real clinical learning situations.</p>

<p>Identifying the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">research paradigm</span> helps readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>, methods, and techniques to ensure rigour and trustworthiness.</p>

<p>As students’ perceptions were previously shown to be related to gender, age, prior experience and place of attachment,[REF] we purposely selected respondents with different backgrounds. This sampling strategy led to the diversity of gender, age, prior patient experience and place of attachment shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>Purposive sampling was directed towards achieving maximum variation in age and specialty, using a snowball approach (‘a non-probabilistic form of sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample’).[REF ]</p>

<p>Potential participants were all medical students in Years 1 and 2 at the University of Toronto in 2004. Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e-mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group). There were no exclusion criteria and we accepted the first 15 students from each class who volunteered.</p>

<p>Journals will require an ethical approval statement.</p>
<p>Qualitative research often involves interaction between researchers and research participants. Correspondingly, researchers should ensure that participants are fully aware of their participation in a research study, the risks and benefits associated with the study, the steps and precautions the researchers will take to minimize risks, such as loss of privacy and confidentiality, and how the researchers plan to use the data.</p>

<p>Ethical approval was granted by the University of Otago and student participants were invited to attend each focus group discussion by the university representatives of New Zealand Medical Students Association (NZMSA). Usually, a key concern when collecting data from students is that students may feel vulnerable when sharing their experiences with academic staff during a focus group discussion. However, this potential harm was removed as each group discussion was facilitated by a fellow student, the discussions were transcribed by a professional transcribing service, and only the primary researchers [Names] had access to the raw data.</p>

<p>…we brought sensitizing concepts to the analysis while we conducted an open, inductive analysis.[REF]In this case the sensitizing concepts arose, a priori to analysis, from a framework derived from the literature [REF] (as described above), in which participants’ motivations to act are based on principles of professionalism, internal affect, or potential implications of their actions.[REF]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Through an iterative process of listening, discussing, and relistening, the team identified and consensually validated emerging themes[REF] and appended segments of dialogue supporting the proposed themes. Recruitment stopped when saturation was reached (no new themes were identified). The team systematically reviewed the themes and sorted them into content domains. The team used an analytic matrix to identify patterns and connections amongst the domains. Two of us not involved in the qualitative coding process (R.E., M.K.) audited the analytic matrix, choice of quotes, and thematic analysis.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The analysis started after the first interview. All data were analyzed with the aid of the audio- coding facility of the NVivo 8: QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Vic, Australia programme. First, [name] and [name] coded independently from one another, making sure to stay semantically close to the participants’ wording. Then we discussed these open codes and defined axial codes.[REF] New insights about the impact of CST were written down in memos.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Videotapes were analysed using immersion/crystallisation methods of qualitative data analysis.[REF] With no pre-existing framework developed in advance for analysis, an inductive approach was used to discover patterns of NVB in the data. A team of six researchers met weekly for 18 months to view videos together. Using a consensus-building approach based on a combination of field notes, ‘opportunistic’ interviews with the participants, and repeated viewing of the same material, sometimes many months apart, we eventually achieved consensus on verbal, non-verbal, and physical themes and patterns observed in the data. Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit,’ we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All transcripts were coded thematically by four of the five authors, who met regularly to identify areas of convergence until full agreement was reached. One of the interviewers (P.M.) maintained an audit trail to track the team’s developing thinking. A process of dialectical empiricism[REF] was used to categorise the emergent themes into more abstract concepts…</p>

<p>The interview data were triangulated with the data of 11 student and supervisor focus groups of a previous study, and more specifically, with those data that concern in particular the influence of CST [Communication Skills Training] on the development of patient-centredness…. Triangulation with the focus group data allowed us to broaden the in-depth information from the interviews in the analysis and to ‘share and compare’ this with information from students and doctors with varying levels of CST (no, limited, full programme) and from two universities (Universities of Antwerp and Ghent). Moreover, this enabled us to better explore the evolution over time, given that the focus groups included participants at different stages of their study: before clerkships (year 4, undergraduate), during clerkships (year 6, undergraduate), after clerkships (year 7, undergraduate) and postgraduate (general practice trainees, and supervising specialists and GPs; Table 1).</p>

<p>We identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.</p>

<p>Because our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Their three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance).

<p>We identified five interruption types: (1) probing for further data, (2) prompting for expected sequence, (3) teaching around the case, (4) thinking out loud, and (5) providing direction (see Table 1). Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).</p>

<p>This study contributes to the understanding and discussion of the complexity of involving patients in healthcare education. It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs. What is not known, however, is whether perceptions are also affected by type of health profession and the students’ different orientation towards logics of care and science, and issues of authority and power relations.</p>

<p>The study has several limitations. One is that the focus group interview method reveals students’ perceptions rather than their actual behaviors. Observations of the patient-led teaching encounter may have illuminated an understanding of the relationship between patient instructors and medical students. Another limitation is that the PI-led teaching is optional rather than mandatory, which may have influenced students’ attitudes in a positive direction. Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our sample. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data.</p>

<p><span class="added">“Many factors, including professional and personal relationships and activities, can influence the design, conduct, and reporting of the clinical science that informs health care decision. The potential for conflict of interest exists when these relationships and activities may bias judgment (1). Many stakeholders— editors, peer reviewers, clinicians, educators, policymakers, patients, and the public—rely on the disclosure of authors’ relationships and activities to inform their assessments.

<div class="offcanvas-body">
<div>
A term drawn from quantitative research, bias technically means a systematic error, where a particular research finding deviates from a ‘true’ finding. This might come about through errors in the manner of interviewing, or by errors in sampling. In qualitative research this is a problematic concept, since by definition the qualitative researcher is part of the process, and all researchers are different. This human factor has been said to be both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of qualitative method. What can be done in commercial qualitative research, however, is to minimise obvious and avoidable sources of bias, for example by not confining all the fieldwork to one social group or geographic location, by taking steps to recognise the personal views of the researcher, (using techniques such as bracketing), and by working in teams.

<p>Several sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of <em>purposeful</em> (or <em>purposive</em>) sampling.</p>
<p><em>Purposeful sampling</em> means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question.</p>
<p>Other sampling techniques, such as <em>theoretical sampling</em> (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), <em>snowball sampling</em> (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and <em>convenience sampling</em> (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.</p>

A qualitative “approach” is a general way of thinking about conducting qualitative research. It describes, either explicitly or implicitly, the purpose of the qualitative research, the role of the researcher(s), the stages of research, and the method of data analysis. Commonly used approaches include ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, and narrative research.

Qualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives.

For documents, this might include the source, intended audience, date, or type of document.

<li id="fn14"><p>Techniques to enhance trustworthiness will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or methods used. Commonly used techniques include: member checking; triangulation of data sources, methods, and/or researchers; creation of an explicit audit trail; and immersion in the site of data collection for an extended period of time (especially for research in which an observer’s presence is likely to disrupt the phenomenon under investigation). Member checking involves sharing findings, such as descriptions of key phenomena, themes, or an explanatory model, with participants and asking them to verify the accuracy or resonance with their perspectives. Triangulation involves using more than one data source, method, or researcher to add diverse perspectives on the findings of the study and, in some approaches, to test the transferability or generalizability of a model. An audit trail involves careful documentation of all decisions made throughout the study, from initial conceptualization to study design, sampling, analysis, and reporting, to provide transparency and to enable an external researcher to review all the steps involved in the study.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>The nature of these findings and how they are reported will depend on the approach and methodology selected and thus should be in alignment with the approach and methods.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>In qualitative research the distinction between results and discussion tends to blur because analysis often involves interpretation, inference, and synthesis. Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16 and 18 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn18"><p>The discussion provides authors an opportunity to elaborate on their findings in relation to their research question(s) and study purpose(s); connect their findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks; and discuss implications.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>Whereas you should describe techniques used to ensure trustworthiness in the Methods section of the manuscript, this section is about the gaps that you didn’t or couldn’t cover.
