    abstract: "Purpose\_\n        Standards for reporting exist for many types of\
      \ quantitative research, but currently none exist for the broad spectrum of\
      \ qualitative research. The purpose of the present study was to formulate and\
      \ define standards for reporting qualitative research while preserving the requisite\
      \ flexibility to accommodate various paradigms, approaches, and methods.\n \
      \       Method\_\n        The authors identified guidelines, reporting standards,\
      \ and critical appraisal criteria for qualitative research by searching PubMed,\
      \ Web of Science, and Google through July 2013; reviewing the reference lists\
      \ of retrieved sources; and contacting experts. Specifically, two authors reviewed\
      \ a sample of sources to generate an initial set of items that were potentially\
      \ important in reporting qualitative research. Through an iterative process\
      \ of reviewing sources, modifying the set of items, and coding all sources for\
      \ items, the authors prepared a near-final list of items and descriptions and\
      \ sent this list to five external reviewers for feedback. The final items and\
      \ descriptions included in the reporting standards reflect this feedback.\n\
      \        Results\_\n        The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research\
      \ (SRQR) consists of 21 items. The authors define and explain key elements of\
      \ each item and provide examples from recently published articles to illustrate\
      \ ways in which the standards can be met.\n        Conclusions\_\n        The\
      \ SRQR aims to improve the transparency of all aspects of qualitative research\
      \ by providing clear standards for reporting qualitative research. These standards\
      \ will assist authors during manuscript preparation, editors and reviewers in\
      \ evaluating a manuscript for potential publication, and readers when critically\
      \ appraising, applying, and synthesizing study findings."
