  abstract: "Purpose\_\n        Standards for reporting exist for many types of quantitative\
    \ research, but currently none exist for the broad spectrum of qualitative research.\
    \ The purpose of the present study was to formulate and define standards for reporting\
    \ qualitative research while preserving the requisite flexibility to accommodate\
    \ various paradigms, approaches, and methods.\n        Method\_\n        The authors\
    \ identified guidelines, reporting standards, and critical appraisal criteria\
    \ for qualitative research by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Google through\
    \ July 2013; reviewing the reference lists of retrieved sources; and contacting\
    \ experts. Specifically, two authors reviewed a sample of sources to generate\
    \ an initial set of items that were potentially important in reporting qualitative\
    \ research. Through an iterative process of reviewing sources, modifying the set\
    \ of items, and coding all sources for items, the authors prepared a near-final\
    \ list of items and descriptions and sent this list to five external reviewers\
    \ for feedback. The final items and descriptions included in the reporting standards\
    \ reflect this feedback.\n        Results\_\n        The Standards for Reporting\
    \ Qualitative Research (SRQR) consists of 21 items. The authors define and explain\
    \ key elements of each item and provide examples from recently published articles\
    \ to illustrate ways in which the standards can be met.\n        Conclusions\_\
    \n        The SRQR aims to improve the transparency of all aspects of qualitative\
    \ research by providing clear standards for reporting qualitative research. These\
    \ standards will assist authors during manuscript preparation, editors and reviewers\
    \ in evaluating a manuscript for potential publication, and readers when critically\
    \ appraising, applying, and synthesizing study findings."
