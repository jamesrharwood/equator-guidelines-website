**Concise description of the nature and topic of the study. Identifying the study as <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> or indicating the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">ethnography</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>) or data collection methods (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span>) is recommended.**

The authors should provide a title that clearly conveys the topic of the study. We suggest that the title indicate that the study is <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> or include a commonly used term that identifies the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> (e.g., ethnographic study, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>) or data collection methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups, observations). This allows readers and reviewers to quickly identify the type of study.

**Summary of key elements of the study using the abstract format of the intended publication; typically includes background, purpose, methods, results, and conclusions.**

A reader should be able to read the abstract independent of the manuscript and get a sense of the background, purpose, methods, main results and implications that will be described in greater detail in the manuscript. The information presented in the abstract should be consistent with the information presented in the full text.

The abstract's structure typically needs to conform to journal guidelines, but authors should attempt to include the following:

* Background about the problem or phenomenon of interest

* Description of the study purpose or research question;

* Methods, including the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> or perspective (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem6" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">general inductive</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>), <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> (<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem8" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">setting</span>, time period), <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem9" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">sample</span> (number and key characteristics of participants, events, documents), data collection strategies (e g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem10" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">observation</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem4" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interview</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span>) and data analysis techniques

* Description of main findings (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem11" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem12" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">inferences</span>) related to the study purpose and/or research question

* Study implications

In some cases the journal's structured abstract format aligns more with <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem13" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span> paradigms and quantitative approaches than with <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> traditions, so translation may be necessary. For example, what might be labelled "findings" in many <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> research traditions could be reported as "results" in the abstract.

__Purpose__: Although academic centers rely on assessments from medical trainees regarding the effectiveness of their faculty as teachers, little is known about how trainees conceptualize and <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> their role as assessors of their clinical supervisors.

__Method__: In 2010, using a <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem19" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>, five <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem5" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">focus group</span> interviews were conducted with 19 residents from an internal medicine residency program. A constant comparative analysis of emergent <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem11" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">themes</span> was conducted.

__Results__: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.

__Conclusions__: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.

**Description and significance of the problem/phenomenon studied; review of relevant theory and empirical work; problem statement.**

The problem formulation typically appears in the introduction and describes the theoretical and/or practical issues or concerns that make the study necessary. It should provide an overview of what is known about the problem, highlight gaps in current knowledge (the problem statement), and define the scope of the research problem or phenomena addressed in the study (what will and will not be included). It should include a review of theoretical and/or empirical work directly relevant to the problem or phenomena studied. The problem formulation should be described in a way that suggests the need for a <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> (e.g., to elucidate poorly defined or previously unexplored <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem15" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructs</span>, to generate theories or to develop causal explanations connecting processes and outcomes, to understand phenomena as they naturally occur and the role of <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span>, to explore problems involving high complexity, to gain insight into participants’ perspectives when such insight is lacking).

> Regulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? .... In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem7" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">context</span> of real clinical learning situations.

**Purpose of the study and specific objectives or questions**

In <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> research, as in all types of research, the authors should include a statement of study intent. This statement can be framed as one or more research questions, purposes, goals, or objectives. <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">Qualitative</span> studies often explore “how” and “why” questions related to a social or human problems or phenomenon, and they are designed to enhance readers’ understanding of a problem or phenomenon. By clearly stating the purpose of the study, authors set readers’ expectations for the methods, findings and discussion sections of the manuscript.

The <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem21" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">research paradigm</span> is the set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem13" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem14" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem19" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem20" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span>, and critical theory. <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">Qualitative</span> research generally draws from a <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem14" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem19" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span>/<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem20" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span> paradigm. We recommend identifying the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem21" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">research paradigm</span> so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem13" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">positivist</span> or <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem14" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">post-positivist</span>) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem19" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span>/<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem20" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">interpretivist</span>). The paradigm has implications for the study design, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.

<span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">Qualitative</span> research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> content analysis, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem6" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">general inductive</span> <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>) and specific (e.g., <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem2" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">ethnography</span>, <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem3" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">grounded theory</span>, phenomenography). Since the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem21" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">research paradigm</span> does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> should also be clearly defined. Stating the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span>. <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">Qualitative</span> research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) The researcher should explain why the selected <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> is appropriate for the research question, and provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem1" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">approach</span> as needed.

> The study was performed from a <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem19" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">constructivist</span> point of view using an interpretative phenomenological epistemology. Based on the notion that social phenomena are constructed by the communal making of meaning about the underlying phenomena, we aimed to construct insightful accounts of lead consultants’ approaches to educational change, rather than to identify the ‘true’ nature of these approaches. Because the management of change by lead consultants is an under-researched area, we conducted an exploratory <span class="defined" data-bs-toggle="offcanvas" href="#glossaryItem0" aria-controls="offcanvasExample" role="button">qualitative</span> study...
