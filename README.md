# EQUATOR Guidelines Website

This is a draft version of some website pages.

It could live on a subdomain like `https://guidelines.equator-network.org`.

The colours, font, spacing etc. is what came "out of the box".

You can try searching for a guideline called ABCDE.

Guidelines are submodules. See this blog post to read about automatically updating submodules using Github actions:
