                Professor Gary Collins is Head of Prognosis Methodology and Professor of Medical Statistics at the University of Oxford, UK. His research interests are primarily focussed on aspects surrounding the development and validation multivariable prediction (prognostic) models (design, analysis and reporting). He is also interested in the conduct and reporting of studies developing and validating risk prediction models and has published extensively in this area.

                Gary led the development of the TRIPOD reporting guideline for clinical prediction models and is a member of the GATHER working group developing guidance for reporting global health estimates. He is also interested in the systematic appraisal of prognostic studies and is an author of the CHARMS Checklist for conducting systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies. He has more than 120 peer-reviewed articles, editorials and commentaries, including 18 in the ‘big 6′ medical journals, and is the first or last author of more than 50 articles.

                Professor Doug Altman was Professor of Statistics in Medicine at the University of Oxford, UK and founder of the Centre for Statistics in Medicine. He was a co-founder of the EQUATOR Network, chair of the EQUATOR Steering Group, and Founding Director of the UK EQUATOR Centre.

                Doug published over 800 articles in peer-reviewed journals, including many aimed at clarifying statistical methods and ideas for medical researchers. He was the author of Practical Statistics for Medical Research (1991) and co-editor of Statistics with Confidence (1989 and 2000) and Systematic Reviews in Health Care (1995 and 2001). He was a statistical advisor to the Cochrane Collaboration and the BMJ. Doug had a long-standing interest in the reporting of medical research and was an executive member of several groups working on reporting guidelines, including CONSORT for randomised trials, QUOROM / PRISMA for systematic reviews, STROBE for epidemiological studies, and REMARK for tumour marker prognostic studies.

                Dr Jen de Beyer teaches our academic writing, publication, and communication skills courses and develops resources on how to write fantastic health research articles, such as our toolkits. You’re also likely to find her promoting reporting guidelines and clear reporting through our social media channels (@EQUATORNetwork) and at conferences. Jen completed a doctorate in systems biology, focusing on biochemistry, and worked in academic editing before joining the UK EQUATOR Centre in 2015.
        -   title: Paula Dhiman 
            subtitle: Medical Statistician

                At the Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Dr Paula Dhiman investigates how medical research is done, focusing on the methodological conduct and reporting of non-randomised research, with a view to helping improve the quality and integrity of future research. This is known as meta-research or “research on research”. Paula is passionate about statistical methodology and observational research and is particularly interested in prognostic/risk modelling.

                Much of her work experience has been as a medical statistician within Primary Care at the University of Nottingham, where she was awarded a PhD in Medical Statistics (Primary Care) in 2015. More recently, she worked as an advisor for the Research Design Service (East Midlands), helping researchers and clinicians apply for funding for their research through study design, and grant writing.
        -   title: Caroline Struthers
            subtitle: Senior EQUATOR Research Fellow

                Caroline returned to the UK EQUATOR Centre team in October 2019 to lead a MRC-funded Methodology research project.  The project involves developing and testing an online tool called “GoodReports” to help authors identify and use the most appropriate reporting guidelines when writing an article for a medical journal.  The prototype of the GoodReports tool is freely available here: https://www.goodreports.org/.  GoodReports won an international prize in 2018 for its potential to reduce the waste in research caused by poor reporting.  https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/news/equator-network-awarded-for-reducing-waste-in-research

                From May 2014- March 2019 Caroline worked at the UK EQUATOR Centre as Education and Training Manager. She focussed on developing tools and training courses to help embed the use of reporting guidelines in the research process at every stage.

                She is committed to patient and public involvement in health research. She is particularly interested in promoting the use of plain language when writing up research for publication in journals, and when making research publicly accessible through other channels.

The UK EQUATOR Centre, based at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, focuses on national activities aimed at raising awareness and supporting the adoption of good research reporting practices. The Centre works with partner organisations and initiatives and contributes to the work of the EQUATOR Network as a whole. The UK EQUATOR Centre is also the head office of the EQUATOR Network.

Our work focuses on:

* Development and maintenance of online resources.
* [Education and training](../training.qmd). Organising workshops, courses, seminars, conferences for researchers, research students, editors and peer reviewers.
* Collaborative activities to raise reporting standards.
* Research into oncology research: Assessment of methodology issues and development of resources for researchers, editors and reviewers.
