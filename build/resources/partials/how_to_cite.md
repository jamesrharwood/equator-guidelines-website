## How to cite {#sec-cite .appendix}

Describe how you used {{< meta acronym >}} at the end of your Methods section, referencing the resources you used e.g.,

> 'We used the {{< meta acronym >}} reporting guideline[@Citation] to draft this manuscript, and the {{< meta acronym >}} reporting checklist[@Checklist] when editing, included in supplement A'

If you use a reporting checklist, remember to include it as a supplement when publishing so that readers can easily find information and see how you have interpreted the guidance.
