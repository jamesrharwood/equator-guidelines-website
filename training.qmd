### Online training

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-md-8 .g-col-12}

Our online Publication School is highly interactive, with all-group discussion and small-group exercises and discussion. It is held live over Zoom over 4 half-days. 

Participants are welcome to use text chat, mic, and/or webcam in the main room, but need at least a mic for small-group work in breakout rooms. We teach using shared slides, webcam, and audio. Participants receive an electronic course workbook with all notes and exercises.

We do not record the sessions and are unable to offer live captions. Participants need to have Zoom downloaded, rather than using the browser version, as we use registrations. 

**Fees for 4 half-days:**

* Students / PPI representatives: £160
* Academia / public sector / non-profit: £260
* Commercial / private: £500

Upcoming start dates:

* 1 December – 4 December; 9:30–13:30 GMT
* 19 January – 9 February; Mondays 9:30-13:30 GMT
