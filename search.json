Identifying the study as qualitative or indicating the approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory) or data collection methods (e.g., interview, focus group) is recommended.\nThe authors should provide a title that clearly conveys the topic of the study. We suggest that the title indicate that the study is qualitative or include a commonly used term that identifies the approach (e.g., ethnographic study, grounded theory) or data collection methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups, observations). This allows readers and reviewers to quickly identify the type of study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nResidents learning from a narrative experience with dying patients: a qualitative study.\n\n\nMedical students’ perceptions of the factors influencing their academic performance: an exploratory interview study with high-achieving and re-sitting medical students.\n\n\nUndergraduate rural medical education program development: focus group consultation with the NRHA Rural Medical Educators Group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of key elements of the study using the abstract format of the intended publication; typically includes background, purpose, methods, results, and conclusions.\nA reader should be able to read the abstract independent of the manuscript and get a sense of the background, purpose, methods, main results and implications that will be described in greater detail in the manuscript. The information presented in the abstract should be consistent with the information presented in the full text.\nThe abstract’s structure typically needs to conform to journal guidelines, but authors should attempt to include the following:\n\nBackground about the problem or phenomenon of interest\nDescription of the study purpose or research question;\nMethods, including the approach or perspective (e.g., general inductive, grounded theory), context (setting, time period), sample (number and key characteristics of participants, events, documents), data collection strategies (e g., observation, interview, focus group) and data analysis techniques\nDescription of main findings (e.g., themes or inferences) related to the study purpose and/or research question\nStudy implications\n\nIn some cases the journal’s structured abstract format aligns more with positivist paradigms and quantitative approaches than with qualitative traditions, so translation may be necessary. For example, what might be labelled “findings” in many qualitative research traditions could be reported as “results” in the abstract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nPurpose: Although academic centers rely on assessments from medical trainees regarding the effectiveness of their faculty as teachers, little is known about how trainees conceptualize and approach their role as assessors of their clinical supervisors\nMethod: In 2010, using a constructivist grounded theory approach, five focus group interviews were conducted with 19 residents from an internal medicine residency program. A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.\nResults: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.\nConclusions: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n3. Problem Formulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription and significance of the problem/phenomenon studied; review of relevant theory and empirical work; problem statement.\nThe problem formulation typically appears in the introduction and describes the theoretical and/or practical issues or concerns that make the study necessary. It should provide an overview of what is known about the problem, highlight gaps in current knowledge (the problem statement), and define the scope of the research problem or phenomena addressed in the study (what will and will not be included). It should include a review of theoretical and/or empirical work directly relevant to the problem or phenomena studied. The problem formulation should be described in a way that suggests the need for a qualitative approach (e.g., to elucidate poorly defined or previously unexplored constructs, to generate theories or to develop causal explanations connecting processes and outcomes, to understand phenomena as they naturally occur and the role of context, to explore problems involving high complexity, to gain insight into participants’ perspectives when such insight is lacking).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nRegulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? …. In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the context of real clinical learning situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Purpose or research question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of the study and specific objectives or questions\nIn qualitative research, as in all types of research, the authors should include a statement of study intent. This statement can be framed as one or more research questions, purposes, goals, or objectives. Qualitative studies often explore “how” and “why” questions related to a social or human problems or phenomenon, and they are designed to enhance readers’ understanding of a problem or phenomenon. By clearly stating the purpose of the study, authors set readers’ expectations for the methods, findings and discussion sections of the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nThe purposes of this study were to investigate how medical students recognize, respond to and utilise feedback, and to determine whether there are maturational differences in understandings of the role of feedback across academic years in medical school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n5. Qualitative approach and research paradigm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative research) and guiding theory if appropriate; identifying the research paradigm (e.g., post-positivist, constructivist/interpretivist) is also recommended; rationale.\nThe research paradigm is the set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm. We recommend identifying the research paradigm so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, approach, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.\nQualitative research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., qualitative content analysis, general inductive approach) and specific (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenography). Since the research paradigm does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the approach should also be clearly defined. Stating the approach provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research approach to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected approach. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) The researcher should explain why the selected approach is appropriate for the research question, and provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the approach as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nThe study was performed from a constructivist point of view using an interpretative phenomenological epistemology. Based on the notion that social phenomena are constructed by the communal making of meaning about the underlying phenomena, we aimed to construct insightful accounts of lead consultants’ approaches to educational change, rather than to identify the ‘true’ nature of these approaches. Because the management of change by lead consultants is an under-researched area, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study…\n\n\nGiven the relative dearth of explanatory theories about factors affecting medical students’ emotional reactions, we chose to develop one by applying methods associated with grounded theory, specifically constant comparative analysis, to qualitative data obtained from learning logs and interviews. Our approach was constructivist, deliberately using researchers’ own experiences and acquired knowledge to enhance theoretical sensitivity and enrich theory development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Researcher characteristics and reflexivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers’ characteristics that may influence the research, including personal attributes, qualifications/experience, relationship with participants, assumptions, and/or presuppositions; potential or actual interaction between researchers’ characteristics and the research questions, approach, methods, results and/or transferability.\nReflexivity refers to intentional, systematic consideration of the potential or actual effects of the researcher(s) on all aspects of the study process. In positivist and post-positivist paradigms, personal characteristics and perspectives of researchers might be viewed as biases that limit the credibility of study findings, while in constructivist or interpretivist paradigms the characteristics and perspectives of the researchers are important contextual factors that are an accepted part of the study design, data collection, and data analysis. These characteristics and perspectives may explain how the researcher(s) obtained access to the site or participants included in the study or may add valuable insight during data analysis.\nTo demonstrate reflexivity, authors should describe important personal characteristics and perspectives of members of the research team that may influence design, data collection, and data analysis. Relevant personal characteristics might include cultural background, occupation, experience, training, position/ power dynamics, gender, race/ethnicity, and sponsoring institution. Authors should also describe the perspectives, assumptions, prior knowledge, preliminary hypotheses, and/or motives (the “stance”) of the members of the research team.\nAuthors also should describe the researchers’ relationships to participants in the study and what decisions were made in light of these relationships. For example, were any members of the research team part of the sample of potential participants in the study? Do any members of the team teach, supervise, or have any authority over participants in the study? If so, how do these characteristics influence choices about their roles in data collection and analysis? For observational research (e.g., ethnography), it is also important to identify the role of the researcher along a spectrum from passive observer (no involvement in the activity studied) to participant-observer (ranging from some limited involvement in the activity to full involvement).\nThere is no expectation that the study could be precisely replicated; these characteristics and perspectives of the researcher should not be mentioned in the limitation section. (See also Item 14.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nReflexivity was maintained by the research team through the analysis and writing by recording, discussing and challenging established assumptions. In addition both EH and SV kept reflexive diaries.\n\n\nThe first author conducted all interviews and discussion groups. Her own medical undergraduate training took place between 1995 and 2000. She was not known to the participants of this research prior to undertaking the study and deliberately did not undertake any clinical or teaching activities locally alongside this research. Whilst it was useful to ‘know’ (from her own background) what the students were talking about medically (and in terms of detecting items of significance), as a researcher she made conscious efforts not to accept potentially common assumptions at face value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting/site and salient contextual factors; rationale.\nThe authors should describe the setting/site(s) in which the study was conducted, the reason(s) why the setting/site(s) was selected, and the salient cultural, political, historical, economic and/or other external factors that influence the study. This information helps readers interpret the meaning and significance of the study findings by situating them in social, cultural, temporal and other relevant contexts. Additional context may be reported with findings (i.e., the Results section) to add evidence for interpretations and to enhance discussion of transferability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nWe conducted the study among hospital-based clinical teachers of students in years 4 to 6 of a six-year undergraduate medical program at Maastricht University Medical School. Years 4 to 6 are devoted to clerkships in the academic hospital and affiliated regional hospitals. Rotations differ in duration depending on the type of rotation and the discipline, and the sequence of rotations differs among students. During rotations, students spend time in the wards, the outpatient clinics, and the accident and emergency department. Clerkships in years 4 and 5 last between 4 and 10 weeks (“regular clerkship”), whereas students in year 6 undertake an 18-week “senior clerkship” in a discipline of their choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sampling strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow and why research participants, documents, or events were selected; criteria for deciding when no further sampling was necessary (e.g., sampling saturation); rationale.\nThe authors should describe how and why research participants, documents, and/or events were selected for inclusion in (and, if appropriate, exclusion from) the study, along with a justification for this strategy. We recommend that authors describe the sampling strategy rather than simply labeling the strategy (e.g., “purposive” or “snowball”), since such labels do not have a universally accepted definition and, more importantly, since procedures tend to be study- specific. Several sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of purposeful (or purposive) sampling. Purposeful sampling means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question. Other sampling techniques, such as theoretical sampling (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), snowball sampling (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and convenience sampling (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.\nAlthough investigators often do not determine sample size a priori in qualitative research, they should nonetheless describe how they established the final sample size. When appropriate (e.g., when a flexible sampling strategy was used), they should explain the criteria used to decide when no further sampling was necessary. If data collection ends at the point when the researchers determine that “saturation” has been reached, then the specific criteria used to define saturation should be described.\nProcedures used to recruit participants should also be described, including who was involved in recruitment, what their relationship was to participants, how and when recruitment occurred, and why these procedures were selected. (See also Item 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nAs students’ perceptions were previously shown to be related to gender, age, prior experience and place of attachment,[REF] we purposely selected respondents with different backgrounds. This sampling strategy led to the diversity of gender, age, prior patient experience and place of attachment shown in Table 1.\n\n\nPurposive sampling was directed towards achieving maximum variation in age and specialty, using a snowball approach (‘a non-probabilistic form of sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample’).[REF ]\n\n\nPotential participants were all medical students in Years 1 and 2 at the University of Toronto in 2004. Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e- mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group). There were no exclusion criteria and we accepted the first 15 students from each class who volunteered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Ethical issues pertaining to human subjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation of approval by an appropriate ethics review board and participant consent, or explanation for lack thereof; other confidentiality and data security issues.\nQualitative research often involves interaction between researchers and research participants. Correspondingly, researchers should ensure that participants are fully aware of their participation in a research study, the risks and benefits associated with the study, the steps and precautions the researchers will take to minimize risks, such as loss of privacy and confidentiality, and how the researchers plan to use the data. Authors should report approval for the study from an appropriate institutional review board for research associated with human subjects. They should describe procedures used to protect participants, including data collection (e.g., recruitment and informed consent) analysis (e.g., data security and integrity) and reporting of findings (e.g., anonymization of excerpts). If researchers provided compensation or offered incentives to facilitate participation, this should be reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nEthical approval was granted by the University of Otago and student participants were invited to attend each focus group discussion by the university representatives of New Zealand Medical Students Association (NZMSA). Usually, a key concern when collecting data from students is that students may feel vulnerable when sharing their experiences with academic staff during a focus group discussion. However, this potential harm was removed as each group discussion was facilitated by a fellow student, the discussions were transcribed by a professional transcribing service, and only the primary researchers [Names] had access to the raw data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Data collection methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of data collected; details of data collection procedures including (as appropriate) start and stop dates of data collection and analysis, iterative process, triangulation of sources/methods, and modification of procedures in response to evolving study findings; rationale.\nQualitative research encompasses an array of data collection methods appropriate for various paradigms and approaches, including (but not limited to) interviews, focus groups, observations (direct or indirect via video), and review of written text, photographs, and other documents or materials. Researchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). (See Item 11 for triangulation.) Given this diversity of methods, authors should describe in detail their data collection design and method(s) and justify them in relation to the research question(s), paradigm, approach, and other methods. Methods used to decide when to end data collection should also be described (see Item 8).\nQualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages, and thus authors must clearly describe the iterative process of data collection and analysis. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives. If such changes occur during the research process, authors should describe how and why study procedures changed in response to evolving study findings.\nThe study period (start and end dates for data collection and analysis) should be identified so that readers can place the study in temporal context and identify factors not mentioned by the authors that might affect findings, interpretation, and implications. (See Item 8 for ending data collection.)\nAuthors should describe important characteristics of the individuals conducting interviews, observations or focus groups, and methods used to train these individuals. This information clarifies the relationship between the individuals involved in data collection and the participants in the research and also explains what efforts were made to ensure consistency in the data collection process (See Items 6 and 15.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nFurther, it was decided that group interviews, also known as focus group discussions would be the best means of data collection. This is a method of data collection that enables group members to feed off each other’s ideas and an effective moderator will maintain group focus whilst at the same time permitting flexibility in the direction those aspects of the discussion might take. [REF]\n\n\nAdjustments to the interview protocol were made according to early experience and information participants had provided (i.e. redundant questions were eliminated; questions were reworded to improve flow and clarity; additional probes were included).\n\n\nFaculty staff were then interviewed individually by a trained study investigator in a 15-minute, semi-structured interview. This sequence was repeated with other video encounters. Table 2 presents examples of interview questions. Each faculty member was interviewed by at least three interviewers over their various interviews. Interviewers were chosen based on their experience in interviewing. All were trained during a half-day meeting to interpret and deliver the interview guide in the same manner in order to elicit information of a consistent type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Data collection instruments and technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of instruments (e.g., interview guides, questionnaires) and devices (e.g., audio recorders) used for data collection; if/how the instrument(s) changed over the course of the study.\nData collection for qualitative research draws upon a variety of instruments or tools, including (but not limited to) interview or focus group guides, observational protocols and prompts for field notes, and data extraction or coding protocols for selection and analysis of documents, photographs, videos, or other artifacts. The authors should describe all such instruments, guides, and protocols, including their development and cite relevant literatures, theories or conceptual frameworks as appropriate. It is often helpful for authors to provide access to the data collection instrument(s) or a detailed description of them.\nThe authors should also describe the use of equipment for audio or video recording, reproduction of paper documents or computer files, or other processes in data collection. This is relevant so readers understand the full context in which data collection occurred and how this context might have affected data collection (e.g., the influence of recording devices on participants’ behaviors; the nature of inferences drawn from live vs. recorded events).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nTo facilitate the discussion and to maintain consistency over different sets of discussions, key trigger questions were devised prior to the discussion. The opening trigger question was: ‘Thinking back to some of your best clinical learning placements in 4th and 5th year. What was it about those clinical placements that provided good opportunities for learning?’\n\n\nInterviews included discussion of the expectations, processes and consequences of AEE [authentic early experiences]. The interview schedule was derived following identification of questions that could not be fully answered in a systematic review of previous empirical or theoretical literature. It comprised a sequence of topic areas including experiences in action, and areas of frustration in Medical Education such as the learning of content knowledge, achieving functional knowledge, and transfer of knowledge.[REF]… Interested readers can request a copy of the schedules from the corresponding author. Interviews lasted between 20 and 90 min. and discussion groups between 60 and 90 min. All interviews and discussion groups were conducted in private rooms at the participant’s workplace—the medical school for students and faculty, and individual places of work for workplace supervisors (except for one who chose to be interviewed at the medical school). All data were audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Units of study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber and relevant characteristics of participants, documents, or events included in the study; level of participation.\nAuthors should describe the participants, documents, or events included in the study (the units of study). The sampling item (Item 8) describes the target or ideal participants, documents, or events selected for the study. By contrast, Item 12 focuses on description of the actual participants, documents or events included in the study. Authors should describe how the actual participants, documents, or events differ from the targeted sample, why these differences may have occurred, and how this might affect the findings.\nAuthors should describe characteristics of the participants, documents or events that are relevant to the study purpose and research question(s).1 For participants, this might include age, gender, profession, institution, year of training, or relationship to the researcher and/or other participants in the study. For documents, this might include the source, intended audience, date, or type of document. For events, this might include the location, date(s), length, characteristics of attendees or participants in the event, or mood or emotional climate. If the degree of participation varied among individuals (e.g., multiple occasions; interviews and observations), the authors should describe different levels of participation. For example, if some participants were observed and interviewed and others only interviewed, or if some participants completed multiple interviews and others completed a single interview, these variations should be explained. Authors should also explain the reasons for these differences (i.e., the researchers’ choice or the participants’ preferences) and how these different levels of participation were taken into account in the analysis. Authors should also include the dates or timeframe for participation.\nThis information about participants could appear in the Methods section as part of the description of the sample, or at the beginning of the Results section to provide context for the findings presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nOf the 70 Mindful Communication program participants, 46 met the eligibility requirements to participate in the in-depth interviews. We randomly chose and then contacted 22 participants, of whom 20 agreed to be interviewed within six months of completing the program: 15 in person and 5 by telephone. Two declined for lack of time. On reaching saturation after 20 interviews, no further attempts to contact the remaining 24 participants were made.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 31 nursing handovers covering 137 patients, and 21 resident handovers covering 101 patients included in this study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Data processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods for processing data prior to and during analysis, including transcription, data entry, data management and security, verification of data integrity, data coding and anonymization / de-identification of excerpts.\nAuthors should describe the ways in which data are prepared for analysis and managed throughout the analysis process. These activities might include transcription, coding, data entry, and organization of data. When processing audio or video recordings, relevant details might include indication of verbatim transcription of dialogue, additional notes to capture non- verbal information (especially for group interviews or focus groups), and annotations to indicate vocal inflections and utterances, as appropriate for the analytic approach. Authors should also describe procedures used to check transcripts for accuracy.\nAuthors should describe the processes used to organize, compile, and categorize data (e.g., field notes, transcripts, documents, photographs, artifacts) for analysis.\nAuthors should describe procedures used to maintain data security and protect the privacy of participants, as specified in the human subjects protocols. For example, if data are anonymized, the authors should explain how and at what point in the process this occurred. Authors may choose to use anonymous labels or identifiers to represent quotes or excerpts from unique participants, documents or events, in order to reflect the variety of sources from which such data were derived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInterviews were anonymised and each participant was given a code number.\n\n\nThe interviewers and another member of the research team (H.B.) reviewed transcripts for accuracy.\n\n\nWe collected data throughout the admission process through direct observation, audio- recording, and chart extraction. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and anonymized both the overnight and morning case review discussions. We also observed the morning case review discussions in person and collected field notes. For each case review discussion, we copied the admission notes from the patient’s record and de-identified all data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess by which inferences, themes, etc. were identified and developed, including the researchers involved in data analysis; usually references a specific paradigm or approach; rationale.\nTechniques used for data analysis will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or data collection methods selected by the researchers. Correspondingly, authors should be as transparent as possible about the analytic process so that readers can follow the logic of inquiry from the research question(s) to the analysis and findings. For example, this description may involve characterizing the processes and decisions made for initial classification or segmentation of data, pattern identification and description, and/or development of in-depth interpretations.1 If the researchers used an approach that has a well-defined process for data analysis (e.g., grounded theory, discourse analysis, phenomenography), the authors should cite the guiding literature and describe their processes in sufficient detail so readers can judge the extent to which the processes align with the guiding approach. If modification to or deviations from the guiding approach occurred, the authors should explain and justify these modifications.\nAuthors should specify the unit of analysis.1 In qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.\nAuthors should explain the rationale underlying different decisions made throughout the data analysis process to provide as much transparency as possible. In some approaches researchers use memoing or bracketing to make their reflections, interpretations, and links among passages explicit and more transparent to others. In some types of analysis, participants’ perspectives or observations that contrast or deviate from the concepts or themes identified by the researchers are an important part of the analysis. In such cases, the authors must describe how these discrepancies were handled during the analysis.\nDuring the analysis process, researchers may draw upon a theoretical perspective or framework, which may have been identified early in the conception of the study or may be identified by the researchers after reviewing some or all of their data. Either way, the authors should describe theoretical or other influences on their analysis scheme or categories if they exist. Sometimes these are referred to as “sensitizing concepts” to acknowledge that the approach is inductive, but with influence from relevant theory, models, or organizational schemes. Alternatively, themes may be developed from the data with no external influences.\nAuthors should describe which members of the research team are involved in data analysis and what perspective(s) they bring to the analysis. Authors should also indicate if any software was used to assist with data analysis and how it was used (e.g., used to apply codes after the final coding scheme was developed; to extract coded passages for further synthesis and identification of themes; or to identify passages with key words). Simply stating that software was used is insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n…we brought sensitizing concepts to the analysis while we conducted an open, inductive analysis.[REF]In this case the sensitizing concepts arose, a priori to analysis, from a framework derived from the literature [REF] (as described above), in which participants’ motivations to act are based on principles of professionalism, internal affect, or potential implications of their actions.[REF]\n\n\nThrough an iterative process of listening, discussing, and relistening, the team identified and consensually validated emerging themes[REF] and appended segments of dialogue supporting the proposed themes. Recruitment stopped when saturation was reached (no new themes were identified). The team systematically reviewed the themes and sorted them into content domains. The team used an analytic matrix to identify patterns and connections amongst the domains. Two of us not involved in the qualitative coding process (R.E., M.K.) audited the analytic matrix, choice of quotes, and thematic analysis.\n\n\nThe analysis started after the first interview. All data were analyzed with the aid of the audio- coding facility of the NVivo 8: QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Vic, Australia programme. First, [name] and [name] coded independently from one another, making sure to stay semantically close to the participants’ wording. Then we discussed these open codes and defined axial codes.[REF] New insights about the impact of CST were written down in memos.\n\n\nVideotapes were analysed using immersion/crystallisation methods of qualitative data analysis.[REF] With no pre-existing framework developed in advance for analysis, an inductive approach was used to discover patterns of NVB in the data. A team of six researchers met weekly for 18 months to view videos together. Using a consensus-building approach based on a combination of field notes, ‘opportunistic’ interviews with the participants, and repeated viewing of the same material, sometimes many months apart, we eventually achieved consensus on verbal, non-verbal, and physical themes and patterns observed in the data. Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit,’ we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\n\n\nAll transcripts were coded thematically by four of the five authors, who met regularly to identify areas of convergence until full agreement was reached. One of the interviewers (P.M.) maintained an audit trail to track the team’s developing thinking. A process of dialectical empiricism[REF] was used to categorise the emergent themes into more abstract concepts…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Techniques to enhance trustworthiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques to enhance trustworthiness and credibility of data analysis,(e.g., member checking, triangulation, audit trail); rationale.\nAuthors should describe methods used to ensure trustworthiness and credibility throughout the data collection and analysis process. Such methods will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or methods used. Correspondingly, the authors should explain their choice of techniques and why these are appropriate for the particular study.\nCommonly used techniques to enhance trustworthiness include: member checking; triangulation of data sources, methods, and/or researchers; creation of an explicit audit trail; and immersion in the site of data collection for an extended period of time (especially for research in which an observer’s presence is likely to disrupt the phenomenon under investigation). Member checking involves sharing findings, such as descriptions of key phenomena, themes, or an explanatory model, with participants and asking them to verify the accuracy or resonance with their perspectives. Triangulation involves using more than one data source, method, or researcher to add diverse perspectives on the findings of the study and, in some approaches, to test the transferability or generalizability of a model. An audit trail involves careful documentation of all decisions made throughout the study, from initial conceptualization to study design, sampling, analysis, and reporting, to provide transparency and to enable an external researcher to review all the steps involved in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nMember checking\n\nMember checks [REF] with an external TBL expert (R.L.) supported the validity of these analyses.\n\nTriangulation of data types and data sources\n\nThe interview data were triangulated with the data of 11 student and supervisor focus groups of a previous study, and more specifically, with those data that concern in particular the influence of CST [Communication Skills Training] on the development of patient-centredness…. Triangulation with the focus group data allowed us to broaden the in-depth information from the interviews in the analysis and to ‘share and compare’ this with information from students and doctors with varying levels of CST (no, limited, full programme) and from two universities (Universities of Antwerp and Ghent). Moreover, this enabled us to better explore the evolution over time, given that the focus groups included participants at different stages of their study: before clerkships (year 4, undergraduate), during clerkships (year 6, undergraduate), after clerkships (year 7, undergraduate) and postgraduate (general practice trainees, and supervising specialists and GPs; Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit’, we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\n\nTriangulation of Researchers + Audit trail\n\nTo ensure rigor and increase authenticity in our methodology, we used two kinds of triangulation—investigator triangulation and data triangulation.[REF] We sought analytical rigor using an audit trail and multiple coders; our coding team included an experienced clinician (M.G.) as well as a nonclinician with expertise in medical communication and team dynamics (L.L.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n16. Synthesis and interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain findings (e.g., interpretations, inferences, and themes); might include development of a theory or model, or integration with prior research or theory.\nIn qualitative research the distinction between results and discussion tends to blur because analysis often involves interpretation, inference, and synthesis. Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16-19 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.\nAuthors should identify the main analytic findings (e.g., interpretations, inferences, narratives, themes, models). The nature of these findings and how they are reported will depend on the approach and methodology selected and thus should be in alignment with the approach and methods.\nIn most cases, the authors should report a synthesis of their data along with specific quotes, examples, or illustrations derived from their data. Authors might also report frequency, variety, representativeness, counter-examples, concrete details, contextualization, conditions, and qualifications related to their findings. Frequency counts (e.g., the frequency of specific themes or codes) play a limited role in qualitative research, and need not be reported unless they play a meaningful role in interpretation of the data.\nFindings might also include integration with prior literature or theory and/or the development of a theory, model or meta-narrative. Judicious use of tables and figures can help communicate such findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nWe identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.\n\n\nBecause our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.\n\n\nTheir three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance). In each of these areas, medical enculturation was achieved by two overlapping processes, ‘absorption’ and ‘assimilation’, each of which may have distinct implications for postgraduate medical education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17. Links to empirical data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate analytic findings.\nThe authors should provide evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate the more general and abstract concepts or inferences they present as findings. Such evidence is typically de-identified to protect the privacy of study participants, settings, and/or institutions. The evidence may be presented in a variety of ways such as in a table or figure, incorporated into a narrative description of findings, as a stand-alone narrative, or in text blocks embedded in the manuscript text. If word limits or media limitations (e.g.. video) limit the authors’ ability to provide sufficient representation of supporting data, an appendix, supplemental material, or web-based repository could be used to provide access to additional data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nSee Frankel et al. for an excellent example of how to use photographs (or snapshots from video) to illustrate and provide supporting evidence for patterns of behavior identified in the analysis. http://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/21/Suppl_1/i121.\n\nWe identified five interruption types: (1) probing for further data, (2) prompting for expected sequence, (3) teaching around the case, (4) thinking out loud, and (5) providing direction (see Table 1). Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n18. Integration with prior work, implications, transferability, and contribution(s) to the field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort summary of main findings, explanation of how findings and conclusions connect to, support, elaborate on, or challenge conclusions of earlier scholarship; discussion of scope of application/generalizability; identification of unique contribution(s) to scholarship in a discipline or field.\nThe authors should begin the Discussion with a short summary of the main findings. The short summary reminds readers of the main findings and may help them assess whether the subsequent interpretation and implications formulated by the authors are supported by the findings.\nThe authors’ description of their findings or results should include some interpretation of the data in the context of previous findings, experiences, theory, or a guiding paradigm or approach. The discussion provides authors an opportunity to elaborate on their findings in relation to their research question(s) and study purpose(s); connect their findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks; and discuss implications. The authors should explicitly describe how their findings contribute to or advance the field. Implications may include transferability, or specifying the appropriate scope for generalization of the findings beyond the study (e.g., to other settings, populations, time periods, circumstances).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nThis study contributes to the understanding and discussion of the complexity of involving patients in healthcare education. It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs. What is not known, however, is whether perceptions are also affected by type of health profession and the students’ different orientation towards logics of care and science, and issues of authority and power relations.\n\nFor complete examples of Discussions, see:\n\nHenriksen & Ringsted, 2013\nWesterman et al., 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Limitations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrustworthiness and limitations of findings\nAuthors should describe techniques used to ensure trustworthiness in the Methods section of the manuscript. In the Discussion, authors should identify problems or gaps in their efforts to ensure trustworthiness and the potential implications. For example, if researchers intended to interview individuals with certain characteristics, or who might offer different perspectives, but were unsuccessful in recruiting any willing participants, they should explain this issue and describe possible consequences for transferability. (See also Item 18.)\nAll research paradigms and approaches have strengths and weaknesses, and authors should explicitly discuss how the paradigm, approach, and methods they used will influence the situations to which their findings may reasonably apply. (See also Item 18.) In addition, they should explain how specific decisions or events in the conduct of the study strengthen or weaken the rigor of their findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nThe study has several limitations. One is that the focus group interview method reveals students’ perceptions rather than their actual behaviors. Observations of the patient-led teaching encounter may have illuminated an understanding of the relationship between patient instructors and medical students. Another limitation is that the PI-led teaching is optional rather than mandatory, which may have influenced students’ attitudes in a positive direction. Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our sample. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n20. Conflicts of interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential sources of influence or perceived influence on study conduct and conclusions; how these were managed.\nAuthors should identify any real or potential conflicts of interest that might have influenced or could appear to have influenced the research. Authors should also explain how these conflicts were managed in the conduct of the study, and describe the potential impact on study findings and/or conclusions. Some aspects may be mentioned as part of reflexivity (see Item 6).\n\n\n21. Funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of funding and other support; role of funders in data collection, interpretation, and reporting.\nThe authors should describe any sources of funding and other support for the study and the role of funders in data collection, data analysis, and reporting if applicable.\n\n\n\nEthnography\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccaecat mollit deserunt excepteur consectetur proident.

A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.\nResults: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.\nConclusions: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments."

We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the context of real clinical learning situations."

Because the management of change by lead consultants is an under-researched area, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study…\n\n\nGiven the relative dearth of explanatory theories about factors affecting medical students’ emotional reactions, we chose to develop one by applying methods associated with grounded theory, specifically constant comparative analysis, to qualitative data obtained from learning logs and interviews. Our approach was constructivist, deliberately using researchers’ own experiences and acquired knowledge to enhance theoretical sensitivity and enrich theory development."

This sampling strategy led to the diversity of gender, age, prior patient experience and place of attachment shown in Table 1.\n\n\nPurposive sampling was directed towards achieving maximum variation in age and specialty, using a snowball approach (‘a non-probabilistic form of sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample’).[REF ]\n\n\nPotential participants were all medical students in Years 1 and 2 at the University of Toronto in 2004. Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e- mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group). There were no exclusion criteria and we accepted the first 15 students from each class who volunteered."

However, this potential harm was removed as each group discussion was facilitated by a fellow student, the discussions were transcribed by a professional transcribing service, and only the primary researchers [Names] had access to the raw data."

And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.\n\n\nBecause our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community.

Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16)."

Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our sample. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data."

A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.\nResults: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.\nConclusions: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n3.

It should provide an overview of what is known about the problem, highlight gaps in current knowledge (the problem statement), and define the scope of the research problem or phenomena addressed in the study (what will and will not be included). It should include a review of theoretical and/or empirical work directly relevant to the problem or phenomena studied. The problem formulation should be described in a way that suggests the need for a qualitative approach (e.g., to elucidate poorly defined or previously unexplored constructs, to generate theories or to develop causal explanations connecting processes and outcomes, to understand phenomena as they naturally occur and the role of context, to explore problems involving high complexity, to gain insight into participants’ perspectives when such insight is lacking).\n\n\nExample\n\nRegulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? …. In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the context of real clinical learning situations.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

This statement can be framed as one or more research questions, purposes, goals, or objectives. Qualitative studies often explore “how” and “why” questions related to a social or human problems or phenomenon, and they are designed to enhance readers’ understanding of a problem or phenomenon. By clearly stating the purpose of the study, authors set readers’ expectations for the methods, findings and discussion sections of the manuscript.\n\n\nExample\n\nThe purposes of this study were to investigate how medical students recognize, respond to and utilise feedback, and to determine whether there are maturational differences in understandings of the role of feedback across academic years in medical school.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n5. Qualitative approach and research paradigm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, narrative research) and guiding theory if appropriate; identifying the research paradigm (e.g., post-positivist, constructivist/interpretivist) is also recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to:\n\nRead more\nExamples\n\n\nRead more\nThe research paradigm is the set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm. We recommend identifying the research paradigm so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, approach, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.\nQualitative research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., qualitative content analysis, general inductive approach) and specific (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenography). Since the research paradigm does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the approach should also be clearly defined. Stating the approach provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research approach to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected approach. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) The researcher should explain why the selected approach is appropriate for the research question, and provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the approach as needed.\n\n\nExamples\n\nThe study was performed from a constructivist point of view using an interpretative phenomenological epistemology. Based on the notion that social phenomena are constructed by the communal making of meaning about the underlying phenomena, we aimed to construct insightful accounts of lead consultants’ approaches to educational change, rather than to identify the ‘true’ nature of these approaches. Because the management of change by lead consultants is an under-researched area, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study…\n\n\nGiven the relative dearth of explanatory theories about factors affecting medical students’ emotional reactions, we chose to develop one by applying methods associated with grounded theory, specifically constant comparative analysis, to qualitative data obtained from learning logs and interviews. Our approach was constructivist, deliberately using researchers’ own experiences and acquired knowledge to enhance theoretical sensitivity and enrich theory development.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Researcher characteristics and reflexivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers’ characteristics that may influence the research, including personal attributes, qualifications/experience, relationship with participants, assumptions, and/or presuppositions; potential or actual interaction between researchers’ characteristics and the research questions, approach, methods, results and/or transferability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to:\n\nRead more\nExamples\n\n\nRead more\nReflexivity refers to intentional, systematic consideration of the potential or actual effects of the researcher(s) on all aspects of the study process. In positivist and post-positivist paradigms, personal characteristics and perspectives of researchers might be viewed as biases that limit the credibility of study findings, while in constructivist or interpretivist paradigms the characteristics and perspectives of the researchers are important contextual factors that are an accepted part of the study design, data collection, and data analysis. These characteristics and perspectives may explain how the researcher(s) obtained access to the site or participants included in the study or may add valuable insight during data analysis.\nTo demonstrate reflexivity, authors should describe important personal characteristics and perspectives of members of the research team that may influence design, data collection, and data analysis. Relevant personal characteristics might include cultural background, occupation, experience, training, position/ power dynamics, gender, race/ethnicity, and sponsoring institution. Authors should also describe the perspectives, assumptions, prior knowledge, preliminary hypotheses, and/or motives (the “stance”) of the members of the research team.\nAuthors also should describe the researchers’ relationships to participants in the study and what decisions were made in light of these relationships. For example, were any members of the research team part of the sample of potential participants in the study? Do any members of the team teach, supervise, or have any authority over participants in the study? If so, how do these characteristics influence choices about their roles in data collection and analysis? For observational research (e.g., ethnography), it is also important to identify the role of the researcher along a spectrum from passive observer (no involvement in the activity studied) to participant-observer (ranging from some limited involvement in the activity to full involvement).\nThere is no expectation that the study could be precisely replicated; these characteristics and perspectives of the researcher should not be mentioned in the limitation section. (See also Item 14.)\n\n\nExamples\n\nReflexivity was maintained by the research team through the analysis and writing by recording, discussing and challenging established assumptions. In addition both EH and SV kept reflexive diaries.\n\n\nThe first author conducted all interviews and discussion groups. Her own medical undergraduate training took place between 1995 and 2000. She was not known to the participants of this research prior to undertaking the study and deliberately did not undertake any clinical or teaching activities locally alongside this research. Whilst it was useful to ‘know’ (from her own background) what the students were talking about medically (and in terms of detecting items of significance), as a researcher she made conscious efforts not to accept potentially common assumptions at face value.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.

Years 4 to 6 are devoted to clerkships in the academic hospital and affiliated regional hospitals. Rotations differ in duration depending on the type of rotation and the discipline, and the sequence of rotations differs among students. During rotations, students spend time in the wards, the outpatient clinics, and the accident and emergency department. Clerkships in years 4 and 5 last between 4 and 10 weeks (“regular clerkship”), whereas students in year 6 undertake an 18-week “senior clerkship” in a discipline of their choice.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.

We recommend that authors describe the sampling strategy rather than simply labeling the strategy (e.g., “purposive” or “snowball”), since such labels do not have a universally accepted definition and, more importantly, since procedures tend to be study- specific. Several sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of purposeful (or purposive) sampling. Purposeful sampling means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question. Other sampling techniques, such as theoretical sampling (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), snowball sampling (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and convenience sampling (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.\nAlthough investigators often do not determine sample size a priori in qualitative research, they should nonetheless describe how they established the final sample size. When appropriate (e.g., when a flexible sampling strategy was used), they should explain the criteria used to decide when no further sampling was necessary. If data collection ends at the point when the researchers determine that “saturation” has been reached, then the specific criteria used to define saturation should be described.\nProcedures used to recruit participants should also be described, including who was involved in recruitment, what their relationship was to participants, how and when recruitment occurred, and why these procedures were selected. (See also Item 6)\n\n\nExamples\n\nAs students’ perceptions were previously shown to be related to gender, age, prior experience and place of attachment,[REF] we purposely selected respondents with different backgrounds. This sampling strategy led to the diversity of gender, age, prior patient experience and place of attachment shown in Table 1.\n\n\nPurposive sampling was directed towards achieving maximum variation in age and specialty, using a snowball approach (‘a non-probabilistic form of sampling in which persons initially chosen for the sample are used as informants to locate other persons having necessary characteristics making them eligible for the sample’).[REF ]\n\n\nPotential participants were all medical students in Years 1 and 2 at the University of Toronto in 2004. Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e- mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group). There were no exclusion criteria and we accepted the first 15 students from each class who volunteered.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

Correspondingly, researchers should ensure that participants are fully aware of their participation in a research study, the risks and benefits associated with the study, the steps and precautions the researchers will take to minimize risks, such as loss of privacy and confidentiality, and how the researchers plan to use the data. Authors should report approval for the study from an appropriate institutional review board for research associated with human subjects. They should describe procedures used to protect participants, including data collection (e.g., recruitment and informed consent) analysis (e.g., data security and integrity) and reporting of findings (e.g., anonymization of excerpts). If researchers provided compensation or offered incentives to facilitate participation, this should be reported.\n\n\nExamples\n\nEthical approval was granted by the University of Otago and student participants were invited to attend each focus group discussion by the university representatives of New Zealand Medical Students Association (NZMSA). Usually, a key concern when collecting data from students is that students may feel vulnerable when sharing their experiences with academic staff during a focus group discussion. However, this potential harm was removed as each group discussion was facilitated by a fellow student, the discussions were transcribed by a professional transcribing service, and only the primary researchers [Names] had access to the raw data.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Data collection methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of data collected; details of data collection procedures including (as appropriate) start and stop dates of data collection and analysis, iterative process, triangulation of sources/methods, and modification of procedures in response to evolving study findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to:\n\nRead more\nExamples\n\n\nRead more\nQualitative research encompasses an array of data collection methods appropriate for various paradigms and approaches, including (but not limited to) interviews, focus groups, observations (direct or indirect via video), and review of written text, photographs, and other documents or materials. Researchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). (See Item 11 for triangulation.) Given this diversity of methods, authors should describe in detail their data collection design and method(s) and justify them in relation to the research question(s), paradigm, approach, and other methods. Methods used to decide when to end data collection should also be described (see Item 8).\nQualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages, and thus authors must clearly describe the iterative process of data collection and analysis. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives. If such changes occur during the research process, authors should describe how and why study procedures changed in response to evolving study findings.\nThe study period (start and end dates for data collection and analysis) should be identified so that readers can place the study in temporal context and identify factors not mentioned by the authors that might affect findings, interpretation, and implications. (See Item 8 for ending data collection.)\nAuthors should describe important characteristics of the individuals conducting interviews, observations or focus groups, and methods used to train these individuals. This information clarifies the relationship between the individuals involved in data collection and the participants in the research and also explains what efforts were made to ensure consistency in the data collection process (See Items 6 and 15.)\n\n\nExamples\n\nFurther, it was decided that group interviews, also known as focus group discussions would be the best means of data collection. This is a method of data collection that enables group members to feed off each other’s ideas and an effective moderator will maintain group focus whilst at the same time permitting flexibility in the direction those aspects of the discussion might take. [REF]\n\n\nAdjustments to the interview protocol were made according to early experience and information participants had provided (i.e. redundant questions were eliminated; questions were reworded to improve flow and clarity; additional probes were included).\n\n\nFaculty staff were then interviewed individually by a trained study investigator in a 15-minute, semi-structured interview. This sequence was repeated with other video encounters. Table 2 presents examples of interview questions. Each faculty member was interviewed by at least three interviewers over their various interviews. Interviewers were chosen based on their experience in interviewing. All were trained during a half-day meeting to interpret and deliver the interview guide in the same manner in order to elicit information of a consistent type.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Data collection instruments and technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of instruments (e.g., interview guides, questionnaires) and devices (e.g., audio recorders) used for data collection; if/how the instrument(s) changed over the course of the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to:\n\nRead more\nExamples\n\n\nRead more\nData collection for qualitative research draws upon a variety of instruments or tools, including (but not limited to) interview or focus group guides, observational protocols and prompts for field notes, and data extraction or coding protocols for selection and analysis of documents, photographs, videos, or other artifacts. The authors should describe all such instruments, guides, and protocols, including their development and cite relevant literatures, theories or conceptual frameworks as appropriate. It is often helpful for authors to provide access to the data collection instrument(s) or a detailed description of them.\nThe authors should also describe the use of equipment for audio or video recording, reproduction of paper documents or computer files, or other processes in data collection. This is relevant so readers understand the full context in which data collection occurred and how this context might have affected data collection (e.g., the influence of recording devices on participants’ behaviors; the nature of inferences drawn from live vs. recorded events).\n\n\nExamples\n\nTo facilitate the discussion and to maintain consistency over different sets of discussions, key trigger questions were devised prior to the discussion. The opening trigger question was: ‘Thinking back to some of your best clinical learning placements in 4th and 5th year. What was it about those clinical placements that provided good opportunities for learning?’\n\n\nInterviews included discussion of the expectations, processes and consequences of AEE [authentic early experiences]. The interview schedule was derived following identification of questions that could not be fully answered in a systematic review of previous empirical or theoretical literature. It comprised a sequence of topic areas including experiences in action, and areas of frustration in Medical Education such as the learning of content knowledge, achieving functional knowledge, and transfer of knowledge.[REF]… Interested readers can request a copy of the schedules from the corresponding author. Interviews lasted between 20 and 90 min. and discussion groups between 60 and 90 min. All interviews and discussion groups were conducted in private rooms at the participant’s workplace—the medical school for students and faculty, and individual places of work for workplace supervisors (except for one who chose to be interviewed at the medical school). All data were audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.

The sampling item (Item 8) describes the target or ideal participants, documents, or events selected for the study. By contrast, Item 12 focuses on description of the actual participants, documents or events included in the study. Authors should describe how the actual participants, documents, or events differ from the targeted sample, why these differences may have occurred, and how this might affect the findings.\nAuthors should describe characteristics of the participants, documents or events that are relevant to the study purpose and research question(s).1 For participants, this might include age, gender, profession, institution, year of training, or relationship to the researcher and/or other participants in the study. For documents, this might include the source, intended audience, date, or type of document. For events, this might include the location, date(s), length, characteristics of attendees or participants in the event, or mood or emotional climate. If the degree of participation varied among individuals (e.g., multiple occasions; interviews and observations), the authors should describe different levels of participation. For example, if some participants were observed and interviewed and others only interviewed, or if some participants completed multiple interviews and others completed a single interview, these variations should be explained. Authors should also explain the reasons for these differences (i.e., the researchers’ choice or the participants’ preferences) and how these different levels of participation were taken into account in the analysis. Authors should also include the dates or timeframe for participation.\nThis information about participants could appear in the Methods section as part of the description of the sample, or at the beginning of the Results section to provide context for the findings presented.\n\n\nExample\n\nOf the 70 Mindful Communication program participants, 46 met the eligibility requirements to participate in the in-depth interviews. We randomly chose and then contacted 22 participants, of whom 20 agreed to be interviewed within six months of completing the program: 15 in person and 5 by telephone. Two declined for lack of time. On reaching saturation after 20 interviews, no further attempts to contact the remaining 24 participants were made.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 31 nursing handovers covering 137 patients, and 21 resident handovers covering 101 patients included in this study.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.

These activities might include transcription, coding, data entry, and organization of data. When processing audio or video recordings, relevant details might include indication of verbatim transcription of dialogue, additional notes to capture non- verbal information (especially for group interviews or focus groups), and annotations to indicate vocal inflections and utterances, as appropriate for the analytic approach. Authors should also describe procedures used to check transcripts for accuracy.\nAuthors should describe the processes used to organize, compile, and categorize data (e.g., field notes, transcripts, documents, photographs, artifacts) for analysis.\nAuthors should describe procedures used to maintain data security and protect the privacy of participants, as specified in the human subjects protocols. For example, if data are anonymized, the authors should explain how and at what point in the process this occurred. Authors may choose to use anonymous labels or identifiers to represent quotes or excerpts from unique participants, documents or events, in order to reflect the variety of sources from which such data were derived.\n\n\nExamples\n\nInterviews were anonymised and each participant was given a code number.\n\n\nThe interviewers and another member of the research team (H.B.) reviewed transcripts for accuracy.\n\n\nWe collected data throughout the admission process through direct observation, audio- recording, and chart extraction. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and anonymized both the overnight and morning case review discussions. We also observed the morning case review discussions in person and collected field notes. For each case review discussion, we copied the admission notes from the patient’s record and de-identified all data.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess by which inferences, themes, etc. were identified and developed, including the researchers involved in data analysis; usually references a specific paradigm or approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to:\n\nRead more\nExamples\n\n\nRead more\nTechniques used for data analysis will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or data collection methods selected by the researchers. Correspondingly, authors should be as transparent as possible about the analytic process so that readers can follow the logic of inquiry from the research question(s) to the analysis and findings. For example, this description may involve characterizing the processes and decisions made for initial classification or segmentation of data, pattern identification and description, and/or development of in-depth interpretations.1 If the researchers used an approach that has a well-defined process for data analysis (e.g., grounded theory, discourse analysis, phenomenography), the authors should cite the guiding literature and describe their processes in sufficient detail so readers can judge the extent to which the processes align with the guiding approach. If modification to or deviations from the guiding approach occurred, the authors should explain and justify these modifications.\nAuthors should specify the unit of analysis.1 In qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.\nAuthors should explain the rationale underlying different decisions made throughout the data analysis process to provide as much transparency as possible. In some approaches researchers use memoing or bracketing to make their reflections, interpretations, and links among passages explicit and more transparent to others. In some types of analysis, participants’ perspectives or observations that contrast or deviate from the concepts or themes identified by the researchers are an important part of the analysis. In such cases, the authors must describe how these discrepancies were handled during the analysis.\nDuring the analysis process, researchers may draw upon a theoretical perspective or framework, which may have been identified early in the conception of the study or may be identified by the researchers after reviewing some or all of their data. Either way, the authors should describe theoretical or other influences on their analysis scheme or categories if they exist. Sometimes these are referred to as “sensitizing concepts” to acknowledge that the approach is inductive, but with influence from relevant theory, models, or organizational schemes. Alternatively, themes may be developed from the data with no external influences.\nAuthors should describe which members of the research team are involved in data analysis and what perspective(s) they bring to the analysis. Authors should also indicate if any software was used to assist with data analysis and how it was used (e.g., used to apply codes after the final coding scheme was developed; to extract coded passages for further synthesis and identification of themes; or to identify passages with key words). Simply stating that software was used is insufficient.\n\n\nExamples\n\n…we brought sensitizing concepts to the analysis while we conducted an open, inductive analysis.[REF]In this case the sensitizing concepts arose, a priori to analysis, from a framework derived from the literature [REF] (as described above), in which participants’ motivations to act are based on principles of professionalism, internal affect, or potential implications of their actions.[REF]\n\n\nThrough an iterative process of listening, discussing, and relistening, the team identified and consensually validated emerging themes[REF] and appended segments of dialogue supporting the proposed themes. Recruitment stopped when saturation was reached (no new themes were identified). The team systematically reviewed the themes and sorted them into content domains. The team used an analytic matrix to identify patterns and connections amongst the domains. Two of us not involved in the qualitative coding process (R.E., M.K.) audited the analytic matrix, choice of quotes, and thematic analysis.\n\n\nThe analysis started after the first interview. All data were analyzed with the aid of the audio- coding facility of the NVivo 8: QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Vic, Australia programme. First, [name] and [name] coded independently from one another, making sure to stay semantically close to the participants’ wording. Then we discussed these open codes and defined axial codes.[REF] New insights about the impact of CST were written down in memos.\n\n\nVideotapes were analysed using immersion/crystallisation methods of qualitative data analysis.[REF] With no pre-existing framework developed in advance for analysis, an inductive approach was used to discover patterns of NVB in the data. A team of six researchers met weekly for 18 months to view videos together. Using a consensus-building approach based on a combination of field notes, ‘opportunistic’ interviews with the participants, and repeated viewing of the same material, sometimes many months apart, we eventually achieved consensus on verbal, non-verbal, and physical themes and patterns observed in the data. Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit,’ we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\n\n\nAll transcripts were coded thematically by four of the five authors, who met regularly to identify areas of convergence until full agreement was reached. One of the interviewers (P.M.) maintained an audit trail to track the team’s developing thinking. A process of dialectical empiricism[REF] was used to categorise the emergent themes into more abstract concepts…\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Techniques to enhance trustworthiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechniques to enhance trustworthiness and credibility of data analysis,(e.g., member checking, triangulation, audit trail); rationale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to:\n\nRead more\nExamples\n\n\nRead more\nAuthors should describe methods used to ensure trustworthiness and credibility throughout the data collection and analysis process. Such methods will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or methods used. Correspondingly, the authors should explain their choice of techniques and why these are appropriate for the particular study.\nCommonly used techniques to enhance trustworthiness include: member checking; triangulation of data sources, methods, and/or researchers; creation of an explicit audit trail; and immersion in the site of data collection for an extended period of time (especially for research in which an observer’s presence is likely to disrupt the phenomenon under investigation). Member checking involves sharing findings, such as descriptions of key phenomena, themes, or an explanatory model, with participants and asking them to verify the accuracy or resonance with their perspectives. Triangulation involves using more than one data source, method, or researcher to add diverse perspectives on the findings of the study and, in some approaches, to test the transferability or generalizability of a model. An audit trail involves careful documentation of all decisions made throughout the study, from initial conceptualization to study design, sampling, analysis, and reporting, to provide transparency and to enable an external researcher to review all the steps involved in the study.\n\n\nExamples\nMember checking\n\nMember checks [REF] with an external TBL expert (R.L.) supported the validity of these analyses.\n\nTriangulation of data types and data sources\n\nThe interview data were triangulated with the data of 11 student and supervisor focus groups of a previous study, and more specifically, with those data that concern in particular the influence of CST [Communication Skills Training] on the development of patient-centredness…. Triangulation with the focus group data allowed us to broaden the in-depth information from the interviews in the analysis and to ‘share and compare’ this with information from students and doctors with varying levels of CST (no, limited, full programme) and from two universities (Universities of Antwerp and Ghent). Moreover, this enabled us to better explore the evolution over time, given that the focus groups included participants at different stages of their study: before clerkships (year 4, undergraduate), during clerkships (year 6, undergraduate), after clerkships (year 7, undergraduate) and postgraduate (general practice trainees, and supervising specialists and GPs; Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit’, we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\n\nTriangulation of Researchers + Audit trail\n\nTo ensure rigor and increase authenticity in our methodology, we used two kinds of triangulation—investigator triangulation and data triangulation.[REF] We sought analytical rigor using an audit trail and multiple coders; our coding team included an experienced clinician (M.G.) as well as a nonclinician with expertise in medical communication and team dynamics (L.L.).\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n16.

Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16-19 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.\nAuthors should identify the main analytic findings (e.g., interpretations, inferences, narratives, themes, models). The nature of these findings and how they are reported will depend on the approach and methodology selected and thus should be in alignment with the approach and methods.\nIn most cases, the authors should report a synthesis of their data along with specific quotes, examples, or illustrations derived from their data. Authors might also report frequency, variety, representativeness, counter-examples, concrete details, contextualization, conditions, and qualifications related to their findings. Frequency counts (e.g., the frequency of specific themes or codes) play a limited role in qualitative research, and need not be reported unless they play a meaningful role in interpretation of the data.\nFindings might also include integration with prior literature or theory and/or the development of a theory, model or meta-narrative. Judicious use of tables and figures can help communicate such findings.\n\n\nExamples\n\nWe identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.\n\n\nBecause our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.\n\n\nTheir three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance). In each of these areas, medical enculturation was achieved by two overlapping processes, ‘absorption’ and ‘assimilation’, each of which may have distinct implications for postgraduate medical education.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.

The evidence may be presented in a variety of ways such as in a table or figure, incorporated into a narrative description of findings, as a stand-alone narrative, or in text blocks embedded in the manuscript text. If word limits or media limitations (e.g.. video) limit the authors’ ability to provide sufficient representation of supporting data, an appendix, supplemental material, or web-based repository could be used to provide access to additional data.\n\n\nExamples\nSee Frankel et al. for an excellent example of how to use photographs (or snapshots from video) to illustrate and provide supporting evidence for patterns of behavior identified in the analysis. http://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/21/Suppl_1/i121.\n\nWe identified five interruption types: (1) probing for further data, (2) prompting for expected sequence, (3) teaching around the case, (4) thinking out loud, and (5) providing direction (see Table 1). Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n18.

It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs.

One is that the focus group interview method reveals students’ perceptions rather than their actual behaviors. Observations of the patient-led teaching encounter may have illuminated an understanding of the relationship between patient instructors and medical students. Another limitation is that the PI-led teaching is optional rather than mandatory, which may have influenced students’ attitudes in a positive direction. Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our sample. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data.\n\nBack to top”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n20.

A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.\nResults: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.\nConclusions: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.\nBack to top”"

These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm. We recommend identifying the research paradigm so that readers understand whether the researcher assumes that there is a single, objective reality (positivist or post-positivist) and has thus designed the study to describe this reality or whether the researcher assumes multiple, subjective realities and designed the study to describe these multiple realities, with no attempt to merge or reconcile these realities (constructivist/interpretivist). The paradigm has implications for the study design, approach, methods, and techniques to ensure rigor and trustworthiness.\nQualitative research includes an array of approaches and methodologies, both general (e.g., qualitative content analysis, general inductive approach) and specific (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory, phenomenography). Since the research paradigm does not necessarily dictate particular approaches or methods, the approach should also be clearly defined. Stating the approach provides readers the opportunity to evaluate the fidelity of the research approach to the research question(s) and consider the rationale for modifications and deviations from the selected approach. Qualitative research also includes an array of methods that can be used across paradigms and approaches. (See also Item 10) The researcher should explain why the selected approach is appropriate for the research question, and provide references to theories or traditions that guide the use of the approach as needed."

These characteristics and perspectives may explain how the researcher(s) obtained access to the site or participants included in the study or may add valuable insight during data analysis.\nTo demonstrate reflexivity, authors should describe important personal characteristics and perspectives of members of the research team that may influence design, data collection, and data analysis. Relevant personal characteristics might include cultural background, occupation, experience, training, position/ power dynamics, gender, race/ethnicity, and sponsoring institution. Authors should also describe the perspectives, assumptions, prior knowledge, preliminary hypotheses, and/or motives (the “stance”) of the members of the research team.\nAuthors also should describe the researchers’ relationships to participants in the study and what decisions were made in light of these relationships.

We recommend that authors describe the sampling strategy rather than simply labeling the strategy (e.g., “purposive” or “snowball”), since such labels do not have a universally accepted definition and, more importantly, since procedures tend to be study- specific. Several sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of purposeful (or purposive) sampling. Purposeful sampling means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question. Other sampling techniques, such as theoretical sampling (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), snowball sampling (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and convenience sampling (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.\nAlthough investigators often do not determine sample size a priori in qualitative research, they should nonetheless describe how they established the final sample size. When appropriate (e.g., when a flexible sampling strategy was used), they should explain the criteria used to decide when no further sampling was necessary. If data collection ends at the point when the researchers determine that “saturation” has been reached, then the specific criteria used to define saturation should be described.\nProcedures used to recruit participants should also be described, including who was involved in recruitment, what their relationship was to participants, how and when recruitment occurred, and why these procedures were selected.

Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e- mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group).

Authors should report approval for the study from an appropriate institutional review board for research associated with human subjects. They should describe procedures used to protect participants, including data collection (e.g., recruitment and informed consent) analysis (e.g., data security and integrity) and reporting of findings (e.g., anonymization of excerpts). If researchers provided compensation or offered incentives to facilitate participation, this should be reported."

Researchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). (See Item 11 for triangulation.) Given this diversity of methods, authors should describe in detail their data collection design and method(s) and justify them in relation to the research question(s), paradigm, approach, and other methods. Methods used to decide when to end data collection should also be described (see Item 8).\nQualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages, and thus authors must clearly describe the iterative process of data collection and analysis. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives. If such changes occur during the research process, authors should describe how and why study procedures changed in response to evolving study findings.\nThe study period (start and end dates for data collection and analysis) should be identified so that readers can place the study in temporal context and identify factors not mentioned by the authors that might affect findings, interpretation, and implications. (See Item 8 for ending data collection.)\nAuthors should describe important characteristics of the individuals conducting interviews, observations or focus groups, and methods used to train these individuals. This information clarifies the relationship between the individuals involved in data collection and the participants in the research and also explains what efforts were made to ensure consistency in the data collection process (See Items 6 and 15.)"

Correspondingly, authors should be as transparent as possible about the analytic process so that readers can follow the logic of inquiry from the research question(s) to the analysis and findings. For example, this description may involve characterizing the processes and decisions made for initial classification or segmentation of data, pattern identification and description, and/or development of in-depth interpretations.1 If the researchers used an approach that has a well-defined process for data analysis (e.g., grounded theory, discourse analysis, phenomenography), the authors should cite the guiding literature and describe their processes in sufficient detail so readers can judge the extent to which the processes align with the guiding approach. If modification to or deviations from the guiding approach occurred, the authors should explain and justify these modifications.\nAuthors should specify the unit of analysis.1 In qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.\nAuthors should explain the rationale underlying different decisions made throughout the data analysis process to provide as much transparency as possible. In some approaches researchers use memoing or bracketing to make their reflections, interpretations, and links among passages explicit and more transparent to others. In some types of analysis, participants’ perspectives or observations that contrast or deviate from the concepts or themes identified by the researchers are an important part of the analysis. In such cases, the authors must describe how these discrepancies were handled during the analysis.\nDuring the analysis process, researchers may draw upon a theoretical perspective or framework, which may have been identified early in the conception of the study or may be identified by the researchers after reviewing some or all of their data. Either way, the authors should describe theoretical or other influences on their analysis scheme or categories if they exist. Sometimes these are referred to as “sensitizing concepts” to acknowledge that the approach is inductive, but with influence from relevant theory, models, or organizational schemes. Alternatively, themes may be developed from the data with no external influences.\nAuthors should describe which members of the research team are involved in data analysis and what perspective(s) they bring to the analysis. Authors should also indicate if any software was used to assist with data analysis and how it was used (e.g., used to apply codes after the final coding scheme was developed; to extract coded passages for further synthesis and identification of themes; or to identify passages with key words). Simply stating that software was used is insufficient."

Recruitment stopped when saturation was reached (no new themes were identified). The team systematically reviewed the themes and sorted them into content domains. The team used an analytic matrix to identify patterns and connections amongst the domains. Two of us not involved in the qualitative coding process (R.E., M.K.) audited the analytic matrix, choice of quotes, and thematic analysis.\n\n\nThe analysis started after the first interview. All data were analyzed with the aid of the audio- coding facility of the NVivo 8: QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Vic, Australia programme. First, [name] and [name] coded independently from one another, making sure to stay semantically close to the participants’ wording. Then we discussed these open codes and defined axial codes.[REF] New insights about the impact of CST were written down in memos.\n\n\nVideotapes were analysed using immersion/crystallisation methods of qualitative data analysis.[REF] With no pre-existing framework developed in advance for analysis, an inductive approach was used to discover patterns of NVB in the data. A team of six researchers met weekly for 18 months to view videos together. Using a consensus-building approach based on a combination of field notes, ‘opportunistic’ interviews with the participants, and repeated viewing of the same material, sometimes many months apart, we eventually achieved consensus on verbal, non-verbal, and physical themes and patterns observed in the data. Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit,’ we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\n\n\nAll transcripts were coded thematically by four of the five authors, who met regularly to identify areas of convergence until full agreement was reached. One of the interviewers (P.M.) maintained an audit trail to track the team’s developing thinking.

Consider asking a colleague to complete the reporting checklist on their own as part of this review, or to look through the checklist you already completed. This will allow you to check whether your interpretation of the guidance requirements matches theirs, and whether you have presented information clearly.\n\n\nAdd the completed reporting checklist as a supplement, and ensure you have credited the reporting guideline, checklist, and writing guide.\n\n\n\nInclude your completed reporting checklist as a supplement when you submit to your chosen journal. If your target journal/funder do not accept supplementary material, you can upload your checklist to a repository like the OSF and cite it."

The JID publishes original research on all aspects of cutaneous biology and skin disease. Although the majority of the journal content deals with basic science, its scope includes clinical research, clinical trials and epidemiology. I have been fortunate in working for the JID for the last 6 years as section editor, with particular responsibilities for clinical trials. In 2006, the JID made a clear announcement that it would welcome high quality clinical trial submissions, providing they were registered prospectively and that they adhered to the CONSORT checklist.\nStating such intent is all very well, but how does a journal like the JID go about implementing CONSORT and compulsory trial registration and how does it check on compliance to CONSORT?\nThis is how we did it. I first met with the Managing Editor, Elizabeth Blalock. We devised a system whereby submissions referring to clinical trials are reviewed by the JID office for trial registration details and adherence to CONSORT (i.e., submission of CONSORT checklist, flowchart, and appropriate manuscript headings). When the editorial office is in doubt whether the submission is a therapeutic trial (which is not always easy with studies that mainly look at disease mechanisms), the staff sends me the article to check. If it is deemed to be a therapeutic trial, then the editorial office contacts the authors for proof of trial registration and adherence to CONSORT prior to admitting the manuscript for peer review. Only those submissions in compliance with the full CONSORT (and journal) requirements are sent for content and methodological peer review. Otherwise, I send a note to the Editor-in-Chief recommending immediate rejection.\nThe project has been quite successful with little additional resource implications. The editorial staff (two members) have had to undertake some additional work in screening submissions and querying those they are unsure of, but they have enjoyed the work and they have acquired some new skills in assessing good clinical trial reporting. Most of the work ie explaining where in the document key items have been reported, is pushed back to the authors. The authors are highly motivated to do this as they know that the manuscript will not be processed further until they have met these requirements (which are clearly placed on the journal’s online author instructions). Whilst it is true that the JID publishes few trials, those that are published are of high quality.\nOn a personal level, the project has been good fun, and has meant little additional work to my role as section editor with responsibilities for clinical trials. In fact, it has made my job of checking manuscripts much easier as I can quickly see where on the manuscript the key CONSORT items are meant to be described. It is clear from some of the submissions that some authors have not heard about trial prospective trial registration. When queried, some authors try and register their trial retrospectively after the analysis has been carried out, which defies the purpose of registration. Such papers are returned by the Editor to the authors without further review. I hope this model of working with journal editorial staff teams can help other journals improve reporting of trials in an efficient way. The key ingredients are (i) a committed journal editor (ii) editorial staff willing to take on new roles and (iii) a section editor with an interest in clinical trials to take responsibility for being arbiter for checks and borderline decisions."

    "text": "Jason Roberts\nEdited by John Rothrock, MD and publishing 10 times a year, Headache is the official publication of the American Headache Society. It receives several hundred manuscripts annually, with roughly 35% of submissions arriving, respectively, from both North America and Europe. Roughly 60% of submissions report clinical trials, multi-patient case series or constitute a systematic overview. The majority of content is of a clinical nature but a small proportion of papers are oriented towards the basic sciences. The journal has an Impact Factor that places it just inside the top-third of titles ranked by ISI within Clinical Neurology. In short, it is a typical mid-sized journal.\nDuring 2008, the Headache editorial office undertook a critique of its publishing output over the previous decade. We found several cases of otherwise good papers that had failed to report research methodologies satisfactorily or omitted crucial information that hindered study replication. While this review of previously published material was ongoing, we also began to experience a surge in the volume of submissions. Nearly one-third of 2008 submissions were from authors new to Headache. Unfortunately, it seemed a sizeable proportion of these new papers contained weak methodological reporting (often to the detriment of otherwise interesting research).\nIn an effort to elevate the quality of material Headache published, we decided to overhaul our submission and peer review processes. An aggressive stance was taken: we would ask authors to work harder to improve the quality of their reporting. We also renewed a commitment to our authors to burnish potentially interesting papers. To achieve these twin objectives, we decided to mandate the inclusion of a reporting checklist for all submissions. We hoped the guidelines would compel authors to include pertinent methodological details that in turn would deliver a more uniform standard of reporting across manuscripts. Completion of the checklists would then serve to document where critical reporting elements were recorded in a manuscript, which would assist manuscript evaluation. The provision of reporting guidelines would have the dual purpose of making it clear to authors what the minimum threshold was for publication and aid our reviewers/editorial board in enforcing these standards as part of the peer review process. We took to heart the entreaty of Doug Altman, that though responsibility for good reporting rests with authors, journals have a role to play.\n\nLaunching an Effort to Collect Reporting Checklists\nTo institute this new policy, the editorial office was charged with three tasks: establish which checklists could be employed (step 1); devise a method of collection (step 2) and educate our author base of the benefits of utilizing checklists (step 3).\n\nStep 1\nSome reporting guidelines were well known to us (CONSORT, STARD) but we needed to explore the full range of options. This led us to EQUATOR. EQUATOR’s site was especially useful during this formative stage because it contained a tremendous depth of material from the checklists themselves through to editorials from journals that had already implemented reporting procedures. In reviewing established guidelines we determined 8 were of importance to us (see table 1).\n\n\nStep 2\nAfter selecting the reporting guidelines to be used, the next challenge was to establish a method of collection to accommodate our desire to see guideline adherence and checklist completion as a mandatory exercise. Headache uses the Manuscript Central online submission system, but the challenges of collecting forms through the submission site are similar for other products, such as Editorial Manager, Benchpress and EES. A new step was to be inserted into the online submission process. Authors would identify their study type (for example, Randomized Controlled Pharmacotherapy trials, Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies). The submission system would then respond by providing the appropriate checklist for the author to download and complete (all forms are MS Word documents). The author then has to upload the completed form as part of their submission.\nThe system was re-engineered in such a way that submission was not possible until a checklist file was uploaded. As the Manuscript Central system did not have an inbuilt workflow template to handle our demands at that time, we had to work with the system programmers to have the system configured appropriately.\n\n\n\nStep 3\nAssociated with the launch of the checklist mandate was a program to educate our authors, reviewers and readers. Two editorial board members, upon the launch o f the new reporting policies, published an editorial outlining our official position:\n\nGood reports should contain a clear explanation of the study methods, describe statistical techniques in enough detail to allow verification of the results from original data, report all results, and interpret and present findings in a balanced and forthright way.\n\nAdditionally, the journal editorial office has developed a workshop to run at American Headache Society meetings that incorporates instruction on the benefits of utilizing reporting guidelines within a general conversation on how to write, and submit, a manuscript successfully.\nOur education efforts aim to ensure authors understand that completion of a reporting checklist is not the important task. Instead, it is ensuring the guidelines are used constructively to shape the construction of an article. There is a sense that some authors are not able to make that distinction and see the checklists as an administrative barrier to submission."

    "text": "Jane Doe – Experienced Researcher\nI first came across reporting guidelines when a journal asked me to complete a checklist at the point of submission. At the time, I found it a bit annoying—after spending weeks refining and polishing the manuscript, the idea of going back to adjust the structure or add missing details felt like frustrating red tape. I completed the checklist, of course, but it felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than something helpful.\nThe next time I wrote a paper, I decided to use the relevant reporting guideline right from the start—just to see if it made the process smoother. It turned out to be a really practical tool. Having a clear list of what information to include made it easier to draft the paper, and I found myself making fewer revisions later on. Over time, using guidelines has become second nature. I now refer to them not just when writing papers, but also when planning new studies, preparing funding applications, and writing protocols. By the time I get to the journal submission stage, completing the checklist is quick and reassuring—I already know I’ve covered what’s important.\nI also use reporting guidelines when teaching my students how to write. For researchers who are still developing their writing habits, these guidelines provide structure and clarity. They help demystify what’s expected and build a strong foundation for clear, transparent research communication. If you’re just starting out, I’d really encourage you to give them a try—not just at the end of your writing, but as a tool to guide you from the beginning. It’s made a big difference to my work"

    "text": "Julius Doe – Editor of prestigious journal\nAs a senior managing editor of a medical journal, I care deeply about the quality and usability of the research we publish—and that starts with good reporting. I’ve instructed my editorial and peer review teams to check all submissions against the appropriate reporting guidelines, whether that’s CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, or another guideline. They use these guidelines to assess whether key information is present, clear, and transparent—such as how the study was conducted, who was involved, what interventions were used, and how outcomes were measured. We don’t expect every study to be perfect—research is complex, and limitations are inevitable—but we do expect authors to report their work fully and honestly. A clearly reported study, with a thoughtful discussion of its limitations, is far more valuable to the scientific community than one that hides its flaws. Reporting guidelines help ensure that published research can be understood, used, built upon, and cited—and that’s essential for real-world impact, and essential to maintaining our reputation as a leading journal."

    "text": "Janet Doe – Possible second editor or technical editor\nI work in the editorial office of a well-respected medical publisher, where my team supports dozens of journals and handles over 100 new submissions every week. Our role is to ensure that each manuscript meets a set of minimal standards before it’s passed on to the academic editor for peer review. These initial checks include confirming that ethical declarations are in place, the manuscript is properly structured, and—crucially—that it adheres to the appropriate reporting guidelines.\nWhen a reporting guideline is required, we expect authors to submit a completed checklist alongside their manuscript. To help maintain quality and consistency, our team typically selects a few items at random from the checklist and cross-checks them against the manuscript to ensure the information is actually there. If a checklist is missing or key information hasn’t been reported, we contact the authors and hold the submission until the issues are resolved.\nThese requirements aren’t meant to be obstacles—they’re in place to help ensure your research is clear, complete, and ready for peer review. Using reporting guidelines from the start will not only improve the quality of your manuscript but also help it move through the editorial process more smoothly."

    "text": "June Doe – Peer reviewer and evidence synthesiser\nWhen I peer review manuscripts for journals, I always refer to reporting guidelines to check whether the study has been reported clearly and completely. These guidelines help me spot missing details—things like how the sample was selected, exactly what interventions were used, or how outcomes were measured. I also recommend reporting guidelines to junior colleagues who are new to peer reviewing—they’re a great way to structure your review and make sure you’re thorough. Although I always remind my colleagues that checking for adherence to a reporting guideline is only the first step of a good review. Information has to be present before you can consider the strengths and weaknesses of research.\nI ask authors to fill in those gaps, not just so I can properly assess the quality and validity of the research, but because I know those details matter to other people down the line. Even if something doesn’t seem essential for the initial peer review, including it helps ensure your work is usable, reproducible, and ultimately more impactful.\nFor example, I do a lot of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of health research. To do my job effectively, I need to be able to find relevant studies, understand exactly what was done, extract key information, and compare results across multiple papers. When articles are poorly reported — e.g., the intervention isn’t clearly defined, the patient group isn’t described, or key terms are missing from the title and abstract — it can be incredibly difficult to even locate them through database searches. If important details are vague or missing, I may have to exclude the study altogether because I can’t be confident about what was done or how it fits with the other evidence. That not only weakens the quality of the review, but also means the original study misses out on being cited or informing future research and policy. The research articles that are most useful to me are the ones where all the key information is clearly reported, limitations are acknowledged, and reporting guidelines have been followed. These are the studies I can include, cite, and build on—so they ultimately have more influence and impact."
