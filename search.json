    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nAuthors should define all variables considered for and included in the analysis, including outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders and potential effect modifiers. Disease outcomes require adequately detailed description of the diagnostic criteria. This applies to criteria for cases in a case-control study, disease events during follow-up in a cohort study and prevalent disease in a cross-sectional study. Clear definitions and steps taken to adhere to them are particularly important for any disease condition of primary interest in the study.\nFor some studies, ‘determinant’ or ‘predictor’ may be appropriate terms for exposure variables and outcomes may be called ‘endpoints’. In multivariable models, authors sometimes use ‘dependent variable’ for an outcome and ‘independent variable’ or ‘explanatory variable’ for exposure and confounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does not distinguish exposures from confounders.\nIf many variables have been measured and included in exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, consider providing a list with details on each variable in an appendix, additional table or separate publication. Of note, the International Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new section with ‘cohort profiles’, that includes detailed information on what was measured at different points in time in particular studies1,2. Finally, we advise that authors declare all ‘candidate variables’ considered for statistical analysis, rather than selectively reporting only those included in the final models (see also 16a. Main results)3,4.",

    "text": "Explanation\nA study should be large enough to obtain a point estimate with a sufficiently narrow confidence interval to meaningfully answer a research question. Large samples are needed to distinguish a small association from no association. Small studies often provide valuable information, but wide confidence intervals may indicate that they contribute less to current knowledge in comparison with studies providing estimates with narrower confidence intervals. Also, small studies that show ‘interesting’ or ‘statistically significant’ associations are published more frequently than small studies that do not have ‘significant’ findings. While these studies may provide an early signal in the context of discovery, readers should be informed of their potential weaknesses.\nThe importance of sample size determination in observational studies depends on the context. If an analysis is performed on data that were already available for other purposes, the main question is whether the analysis of the data will produce results with sufficient statistical precision to contribute substantially to the literature, and sample size considerations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculation of sample size may be useful when planning a new study1,2. Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty than implied by the single number that is generally produced. For example, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or other assumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise, if not guesswork3. The precision obtained in the final analysis can often not be determined beforehand because it will be reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multivariable analyses4, the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured5, and the exclusion of some individuals.\nFew epidemiological studies explain or report deliberations about sample size6,7. We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the considerations that determined the study size (e.g., a fixed available sample, as in the first example above). If the observational study was stopped early when statistical significance was achieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers with post hoc justifications for study size or retrospective power calculations3. From the point of view of the reader, confidence intervals indicate the statistical precision that was ultimately obtained. It should be realized that confidence intervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncertainty that may be present in a study (see 20. Interpretation).",

Subgroup analyses are nevertheless often done1. Readers need to know which subgroup analyses were planned in advance, and which arose while analysing the data. Also, it is important to explain what methods were used to examine whether effects or associations differed across groups (see 17. Other analyses).\nInteraction relates to the situation when one factor modifies the effect of another (therefore also called ‘effect modification’). The joint action of two factors can be characterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of risk differences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relative risk (see 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions ). Many authors and readers may have their own preference about the way interactions should be analysed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent the joint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses absolute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinical decision making3. Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above4. A lay-out presenting separate effects of both exposures as well as their joint effect, each relative to no exposure, might be most informative. It is presented in the example for interaction under 17. Other analyses, and the calculations on the different scales are explained below.",

    "text": "Interaction (effect modification): the analysis of joint effects\nInteraction exists when the association of an exposure with the risk of disease differs in the presence of another exposure. One problem in evaluating and reporting interactions is that the effect of an exposure can be measured in two ways: as a relative risk (or rate ratio) or as a risk difference (or rate difference). The use of the relative risk leads to a multiplicative model, while the use of the risk difference corresponds to an additive model5,6. A distinction is sometimes made between ‘statistical interaction’ which can be a departure from either a multiplicative or additive model, and ‘biologic interaction’ which is measured by departure from an additive model7. However, neither additive nor multiplicative models point to a particular biologic mechanism.\nRegardless of the model choice, the main objective is to understand how the joint effect of two exposures differs from their separate effects (in the absence of the other exposure). The Human Genomic Epidemiology Network (HuGENet) proposed a lay-out for transparent presentation of separate and joint effects that permits evaluation of different types of interaction8. Data from the study on oral contraceptives and factor V Leiden mutation9 were used to explain the proposal, and this example is also used in item 17. Oral contraceptives and factor V Leiden mutation each increase the risk of venous thrombosis; their separate and joint effects can be calculated from the 2 by 4 table (see example 1 for 17. Other analyses) where the odds ratio of 1 denotes the baseline of women without Factor V Leiden who do not use oral contraceptives.\nA difficulty is that some study designs, such as case-control studies, and several statistical models, such as logistic or Cox regression models, estimate relative risks (or rate ratios) and intrinsically lead to multiplicative modelling. In these instances, relative risks can be translated to an additive scale. In example 1 of 17. Other analyses, the separate odds ratios are 3.7 and 6.9; the joint odds ratio is 34.7. When these data are analysed under a multiplicative model, a joint odds ratio of 25.7 is expected (3.7 × 6.9). The observed joint effect of 34.7 is 1.4 times greater than expected on a multiplicative scale (34.7/25.7). This quantity (1.4) is the odds ratio of the multiplicative interaction. It would be equal to the antilog of the estimated interaction coefficient from a logistic regression model. Under an additive model the joint odds ratio is expected to be 9.6 (3.7 + 6.9 – 1). The observed joint effect departs strongly from additivity: the difference is 25.1 (34.7 – 9.6). When odds ratios are interpreted as relative risks (or rate ratios), the latter quantity (25.1) is the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI)10. This can be understood more easily when imagining that the reference value (equivalent to OR=1) represents a baseline incidence of venous thrombosis of, say, 1/10 000 women-years, which then increases in the presence of separate and joint exposures.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nMissing data are common in observational research. Questionnaires posted to study participants are not always filled in completely, participants may not attend all follow-up visits and routine data sources and clinical databases are often incomplete. Despite its ubiquity and importance, few papers report in detail on the problem of missing data1,2. Investigators may use any of several approaches to address missing data. We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in 12c. Statistical methods – missing data . We advise that authors report the number of missing values for each variable of interest (exposures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in the analysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values if possible, and indicate how many individuals were excluded because of missing data when describing the flow of participants through the study (see also item 13). For analyses that account for missing data, authors should describe the nature of the analysis (e.g., multiple imputation) and the assumptions that were made (e.g., missing at random, see 12c. Statistical methods – missing data).\n\nMissing data: problems and possible solutions\nA common approach to dealing with missing data is to restrict analyses to individuals with complete data on all variables required for a particular analysis. Although such ‘complete-case’ analyses are unbiased in many circumstances, they can be biased and are always inefficient3. Bias arises if individuals with missing data are not typical of the whole sample. Inefficiency arises because of the reduced sample size for analysis.\nUsing the last observation carried forward for repeated measures can distort trends over time if persons who experience a foreshadowing of the outcome selectively drop out4. Inserting a missing category indicator for a confounder may increase residual confounding2. Imputation, in which each missing value is replaced with an assumed or estimated value, may lead to attenuation or exaggeration of the association of interest, and without the use of sophisticated methods described below may produce standard errors that are too small.\nRubin developed a typology of missing data problems, based on a model for the probability of an observation being missing3,5. Data are described as missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability that a particular observation is missing does not depend on the value of any observable variable(s). Data are missing at random (MAR) if, given the observed data, the probability that observations are missing is independent of the actual values of the missing data. For example, suppose younger children are more prone to missing spirometry measurements, but that the probability of missing is unrelated to the true unobserved lung function, after accounting for age. Then the missing lung function measurement would be MAR in models including age. Data are missing not at random (MNAR) if the probability of missing still depends on the missing value even after taking the available data into account. When data are MNAR valid inferences require explicit assumptions about the mechanisms that led to missing data.\nMethods to deal with data missing at random (MAR) fall into three broad classes3,6: likelihood-based approaches7, weighted estimation8 and multiple imputation6,9. Of these three approaches, multiple imputation is the most commonly used and flexible, particularly when multiple variables have missing values10. Results using any of these approaches should be compared with those from complete case analyses, and important differences discussed. The plausibility of assumptions made in missing data analyses is generally unverifiable. In particular it is impossible to prove that data are MAR, rather than MNAR. Such analyses are therefore best viewed in the spirit of sensitivity analysis (see items 12e and 17).",

    "text": "Explanation\nCohort studies are analysed using life table methods or other approaches that are based on the person-time of follow-up and time to developing the disease of interest. Among individuals who remain free of the disease at the end of their observation period, the amount of follow-up time is assumed to be unrelated to the probability of developing the outcome. This will be the case if follow-up ends on a fixed date or at a particular age. Loss to follow-up occurs when participants withdraw from a study before that date. This may hamper the validity of a study if loss to follow-up occurs selectively in exposed individuals, or in persons at high risk of developing the disease (‘informative censoring’). In the example above, patients lost to follow-up in treatment programmes with no active follow-up had fewer CD4 helper cells than those remaining under observation and were therefore at higher risk of dying [116].\nIt is important to distinguish persons who reach the end of the study from those lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, statistical software usually does not distinguish between the two situations: in both cases follow-up time is automatically truncated (‘censored’) at the end of the observation period. Investigators therefore need to decide, ideally at the stage of planning the study, how they will deal with loss to follow-up. When few patients are lost, investigators may either exclude individuals with incomplete follow-up, or treat them as if they withdrew alive at either the date of loss to follow-up or the end of the study. We advise authors to report how many patients were lost to follow-up and what censoring strategies they used.",

    "text": "Explanation\nMost cross-sectional studies use a pre-specified sampling strategy to select participants from a source population. Sampling may be more complex than taking a simple random sample, however. It may include several stages and clustering of participants (e.g., in districts or villages). Proportionate stratification may ensure that subgroups with a specific characteristic are correctly represented. Disproportionate stratification may be useful to over-sample a subgroup of particular interest.\nAn estimate of association derived from a complex sample may be more or less precise than that derived from a simple random sample. Measures of precision such as standard error or confidence interval should be corrected using the design effect, a ratio measure that describes how much precision is gained or lost if a more complex sampling strategy is used instead of simple random sampling1. Most complex sampling techniques lead to a decrease of precision, resulting in a design effect greater than 1.\nWe advise that authors clearly state the method used to adjust for complex sampling strategies so that readers may understand how the chosen sampling method influenced the precision of the obtained estimates. For instance, with clustered sampling, the implicit trade-off between easier data collection and loss of precision is transparent if the design effect is reported. In the example, the calculated design effects of 1.9 for men indicates that the actual sample size would need to be 1.9 times greater than with simple random sampling for the resulting estimates to have equal precision.",

    "text": "Explanation\nInvestigators make choices regarding how to collect and analyse quantitative data about exposures, effect modifiers and confounders. For example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable (see 6b. Matching criteria). Grouping choices may have important consequences for later analyses1,2. We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of model fitting.\nInvestigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome2–4. Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest.\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied quantitative exposure variables5. In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only two reported checking for linearity. In another survey, of the psychological literature, dichotomization was justified in only 22 of 110 articles (20%)6.",

    "text": "Explanation\nBefore addressing the possible association between exposures (risk factors) and outcomes, authors should report relevant descriptive data. It may be possible and meaningful to present measures of association in the same table that presents the descriptive data (see 14a. Descriptive data – participant characteristics). In a cohort study with events as outcomes, report the numbers of events for each outcome of interest. Consider reporting the event rate per person-year of follow-up. If the risk of an event changes over follow-up time, present the numbers and rates of events in appropriate intervals of follow-up or as a Kaplan-Meier life table or plot. It might be preferable to show plots as cumulative incidence that go up from 0% rather than down from 100%, especially if the event rate is lower than, say, 30%1. Consider presenting such information separately for participants in different exposure categories of interest. If a cohort study is investigating other time-related outcomes (e.g., quantitative disease markers such as blood pressure), present appropriate summary measures (e.g., means and standard deviations) over time, perhaps in a table or figure.\nFor cross-sectional studies, we recommend presenting the same type of information on prevalent outcome events or summary measures. For case-control studies, the focus will be on reporting exposures separately for cases and controls as frequencies or quantitative summaries2. For all designs, it may be helpful also to tabulate continuous outcomes or exposures in categories, even if the data are not analysed as such.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIn many situations, authors may present the results of unadjusted or minimally adjusted analyses and those from fully adjusted analyses. We advise giving the unadjusted analyses together with the main data, for example the number of cases and controls that were exposed or not. This allows the reader to understand the data behind the measures of association (see also 15. Outcome data). For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing values in covariates (see also 12c. Statistical methods – missing data). Estimates should be given with confidence intervals.\nReaders can compare unadjusted measures of association with those adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what direction, they changed. Readers may think that ‘adjusted’ results equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see 12a. Statistical methods ). Thus, great care should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in the statistical model (see also 20. Interpretation)1,2.\nAuthors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models. Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations. Inappropriate decisions may introduce bias, for example by including variables that are in the causal pathway between exposure and disease (unless the aim is to asses how much of the effect is carried by the intermediary variable). If the decision to include a variable in the model was based on the change in the estimate, it is important to report what change was considered sufficiently important to justify its inclusion. If a ‘backward deletion’ or ‘forward inclusion’ strategy was used to select confounders, explain that process and give the significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis of no confounding. Of note, we and others do not advise selecting confounders based solely on statistical significance testing3–5.\nRecent studies of the quality of reporting of epidemiological studies found that confidence intervals were reported in most articles6. However, few authors explained their choice of confounding variables6,7.",

    "text": "Explanation\nGeneralisability, also called external validity or applicability, is the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to other circumstances1. There is no external validity per se; the term is meaningful only with regard to clearly specified conditions2. Can results be applied to an individual, groups or populations that differ from those enrolled in the study with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, severity of disease, and co-morbid conditions? Are the nature and level of exposures comparable, and the definitions of outcomes relevant to another setting or population? Are data that were collected in longitudinal studies many years ago still relevant today? Are results from health services research in one country applicable to health systems in other countries?\nThe question of whether the results of a study have external validity is often a matter of judgment that depends on the study setting, the characteristics of the participants, the exposures examined, and the outcomes assessed. Thus, it is crucial that authors provide readers with adequate information about the setting and locations, eligibility criteria, the exposures and how they were measured, the definition of outcomes, and the period of recruitment and follow-up. The degree of non-participation and the proportion of unexposed participants in whom the outcome develops are also relevant. Knowledge of the absolute risk and prevalence of the exposure, which will often vary across populations, are helpful when applying results to other settings and populations (see 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions).",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nDetailed descriptions of the study participants help readers understand the applicability of the results. Investigators usually restrict a study population by defining clinical, demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants. Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis and comorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibility criteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey of observational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did not specify eligibility criteria1.\nEligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from which the study population was selected (e.g., the general population of a region or country), and the method of recruitment (e.g., referral or self-selection through advertisements).\nKnowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized non-response and loss to follow-up and whether the procedures were similar for all participants, informs judgments about the validity of results. For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detect acute infections, readers needed to know the interval between blood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judge whether some infections likely were missed because the interval between blood tests was too long2. In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial bias due to unequal ascertainment of events or differences in non-response or loss to follow-up3. Accordingly, we advise that researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for all participants, and that they describe the completeness of ascertainment of variables (see also 14b. Descriptive data – missing data and 14c. Descriptive data – follow-up time).\nIn case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of their selection has major implications for study validity. In general, controls should reflect the population from which the cases arose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all with advantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from a general population, population roster sampling, random digit dialling, neighbourhood or friend controls are used. Neighbourhood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching on exposure4. Controls with other diseases may have advantages over population-based controls, in particular for hospital-based cases, because they better reflect the catchment population of a hospital, have greater comparability of recall and ease of recruitment. However, they can present problems if the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing or being hospitalized for the control condition(s)5,6. To remedy this problem often a mixture of the best defensible control diseases is used7.",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe way in which exposures, confounders and outcomes were measured affects the reliability and validity of a study. Measurement error and misclassification of exposures or outcomes can make it more difficult to detect cause-effect relationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error in measurement of potential confounders can increase the risk of residual confounding1,2. It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of the reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity analyses (see 12e. Statistical methods – sensitivity analyses and 17. Other analyses).\nIn addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected. This may be important for laboratory examinations (as in the second example) and other situations. For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve; solutions such as randomising the order of interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may also arise if the compared groups are not given the same diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the same kind than another (see also item 9).",

A recent systematic review found no longitudinal studies on the outcomes of childhood obesity other than physical health outcomes and only two longitudinal studies of the socioeconomic effects of obesity in adolescence. Gortmaker et al. found that US women who had been obese in late adolescence in 1981 were less likely to be married and had lower incomes seven years later than women who had not been overweight, while men who had been overweight were less likely to be married. Sargent et al. found that UK women, but not men, who had been obese at 16 years in 1974 earned 7.4% less than their non-obese peers at age 23.

They obtain information about people and their exposures at baseline, let time pass, and then assess the occurrence of outcomes. Investigators commonly make contrasts between individuals who are exposed and not exposed or among groups of individuals with different categories of exposure. Investigators may assess several different outcomes, and examine exposure and outcome variables at multiple points during follow-up. Closed cohorts (for example birth cohorts) enrol a defined number of participants at study onset and follow them from that time forward, often at set intervals up to a fixed end date. In open cohorts the study population is dynamic - people enter and leave the population at different points in time (for example inhabitants of a town). Open cohorts change due to deaths, births, and migration, but the composition of the population with regard to variables such as age and gender may remain approximately constant, especially over a short period of time. In a closed cohort cumulative incidences (risks) and incidence rates can be estimated; when exposed and unexposed groups are compared, this leads to risk ratio or rate ratio estimates. Open cohorts estimate incidence rates and rate ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase_control_studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case-control studies, investigators compare exposures between people with a particular disease outcome (cases) and people without that outcome (controls). Investigators aim to collect cases and controls that are representative of an underlying cohort or a cross-section of a population. That population can be defined geographically, but also more loosely as the catchment area of health care facilities. The case sample may be 100% or a large fraction of available cases, while the control sample usually is only a small fraction of the people who do not have the pertinent outcome. Controls represent the cohort or population of people from which the cases arose. Investigators calculate the ratio of the odds of exposures to putative causes of the disease among cases and controls (see Item 16c). Depending on the sampling strategy for cases and controls and the nature of the population studied, the odds ratio obtained in a case-control study is interpreted as the risk ratio, rate ratio or (prevalence) odds ratio1,2. The majority of published case-control studies sample open cohorts and so allow direct estimations of rate ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-sectional_studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cross-sectional studies, investigators assess all individuals in a sample at the same point in time, often to examine the prevalence of exposures, risk factors or disease. Some cross-sectional studies are analytical and aim to quantify potential causal associations between exposures and disease. Such studies may be analysed like a cohort study by comparing disease prevalence between exposure groups. They may also be analysed like a case-control study by comparing the odds of exposure between groups with and without disease. A difficulty that can occur in any design but is particularly clear in cross-sectional studies is to establish that an exposure preceded the disease, although the time order of exposure and outcome may sometimes be clear. In a study in which the exposure variable is congenital or genetic, for example, we can be confident that the exposure preceded the disease, even if we are measuring both at the same time.",

In most cases, one wants to know how well the index test classified patients in the same way as the reference standard, when both tests are performed in the same patients, at the same time.1 When a delay occurs between the index test and the reference standard, the target condition and alternative conditions can change; conditions may worsen, or improve in the meanwhile, due to the natural course of the disease, or due to clinical interventions applied between the two tests. Such changes influence the agreement between the index test and the reference standard, which could lead to biased estimates of test performance.\nThe bias can be more severe if the delay differs systematically between test positives and test negatives, or between those with a high prior suspicion of having the target condition and those with a low suspicion.2,3\nWhen follow-up is used as the reference standard, readers will want to know how long the follow-up period was.\nIn the example, the authors reported the mean number of days, and a range, between the index test and the reference standard.",

A medical test may perform differently in a primary, secondary or tertiary care setting, for example. Authors should therefore report the actual setting in which the study was performed, as well as the exact locations: names of the participating centres, city and country. The spectrum of the target condition as well as the range of other conditions that occur in patients suspected of the target condition can vary across settings, depending on which referral mechanisms are in play.1\nSince test procedures, referral mechanisms and the prevalence and severity of diseases can evolve over time, authors should also report the start and end dates of participant recruitment.\nThis information is essential for readers who want to evaluate the generalisability of the study findings, and their applicability to specific questions, for those who would like to use the evidence generated by the study to make informed healthcare decisions.\nIn the example, study setting and study dates were clearly defined.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIn diagnostic accuracy studies, the reference standard is used for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition in study participants. Several reference standards may be available to define the same target condition. In such cases, authors are invited to provide their rationale for selecting the specific reference standard from the available alternatives. This may depend on the intended use of the index test, the clinical relevance or practical and/or ethical reasons.\nAlternative reference standards are not always in perfect agreement. Some reference standards are less accurate than others. In other cases, different reference standards reflect related but different manifestations or stages of the disease, as in confirmation by imaging (first reference standard) versus clinical events (second reference standard).\nIn the example, the authors selected the MINI, a structured diagnostic interview commonly used for psychiatric evaluations, as the reference standard for identifying depression and suicide risk in adults with epilepsy. As a rationale for their choice, they claimed that the MINI test was short to administer, efficient for clinical and research purposes, reliable and valid when compared with alternative diagnostic interviews.",

    "text": "Explanation\nMost target conditions are not fixed states, either present or absent; many diseases cover a continuum, ranging from minute pathological changes to advanced clinical disease. Test sensitivity is often higher in studies in which more patients have advanced stages of the target condition, as these cases are often easier to identify by the index test.1,2 The type, spectrum and frequency of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition may also influence test accuracy; typically, the healthier the patients without the target condition, the less frequently one would find false-positive results of the index test.1\nAn adequate description of the severity of disease in those with the target condition and of the alternative conditions in those without it allows the reader to judge both the validity of the study, relative to the study question and the applicability of the study findings to the reader's clinical question.\nIn the example, the authors investigated the accuracy of exercise tests for diagnosing coronary artery disease. They reported the distribution of severity of disease in terms of the number of vessels involved; the more vessels, the more severe the coronary artery disease would be. Sensitivity of test exercises was higher in those with more diseased vessels (39% for single vessel disease, 58% for two and 77% for three vessels).3",

    "text": "Explanation\nMissing data are common in any type of biomedical research. In diagnostic accuracy studies, they can occur for the index test and reference standard. There are several ways to deal with them when analysing the data.1 Many researchers exclude participants without an observed test result. This is known as ‘complete case’ or ‘available case’ analysis. This may lead to a loss in precision and can introduce bias, especially if having a missing index test or reference standard result is related to having the target condition.\nParticipants with missing test results can be included in the analysis if missing results are imputed.1 Another option is to assess the impact of missing test results on estimates of accuracy by considering different scenarios. For the index test, for example, in the ‘worst-case scenario’, all missing index test results are considered false-positive or false-negative depending on the reference standard result; in the ‘best-case scenario’, all missing index test results are considered true-positive or true-negative.\nIn the example, the authors explicitly reported how many cases with missing index test data they encountered and how they handled these data: they excluded them, but also applied a ‘worst-case scenario’.",

Many studies have shown between-reader variability, especially in the field of imaging.4,5 The quality of reading has also been shown to be affected in cytology and microbiology by professional background, expertise and prior training to improve interpretation and to reduce interobserver variation.6 Information about the amount of training of the persons in the study who read the index test can help readers to judge whether similar results are achievable in their own settings.\nIn some cases, a study depends on multiple reference standards. Patients with lesions on an imaging test under evaluation may, for example, undergo biopsy with a final diagnosis based on histology, whereas patients without lesions on the index test undergo clinical follow-up as reference standard. This could be a potential source of bias, so authors should specify which patient groups received which reference standard.7,8\nMore specific guidance for specialised fields of testing, or certain types of tests, will be developed in future STARD extensions. Whenever available, these extensions will be made available on the STARD pages at the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) website (http://www.equator-network.org/).\nIn the example, the authors described how blood samples were collected and processed in the laboratory.

    "text": "Explanation\nWhen searching for relevant biomedical studies on a certain topic, electronic databases such as MEDLINE and Embase are indispensable. To facilitate retrieval of their article, authors can explicitly identify it as a report of a diagnostic accuracy study. This can be performed by using terms in the title and/or abstract that refer to measures of diagnostic accuracy, such as ‘sensitivity’, ‘specificity’, ‘positive predictive value’, ‘negative predictive value’, ‘area under the ROC curve (AUC)’ or ‘likelihood ratio’.\nIn 1991, MEDLINE introduced a specific keyword (MeSH heading) for indexing diagnostic studies: ‘Sensitivity and Specificity.’ Unfortunately, the sensitivity of using this particular MeSH heading to identify diagnostic accuracy studies can be as low as 51%.1 As of May 2015, Embase's thesaurus (Emtree) has 38 check tags for study types; ‘diagnostic test accuracy study’ is one of them, but was only introduced in 2011.\nIn the example, the authors mentioned the terms ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’ in the abstract. The article will now be retrieved when using one of these terms in a search strategy, and will be easily identifiable as one describing a diagnostic accuracy study.",

    "text": "Explanation\nEstimates of diagnostic accuracy may be biased if not all eligible participants undergo the index test and the desired reference standard.1 This includes studies in which not all study participants undergo the reference standard, as well as studies where some of the participants receive a different reference standard.2 Incomplete verification by the reference standard occurs in up to 26% of diagnostic studies; it is especially common when the reference standard is an invasive procedure.3\nTo allow the readers to appreciate the potential for bias, authors are invited to build a diagram to illustrate the flow of participants through the study. Such a diagram also illustrates the basic structure of the study. An example of a prototypical STARD flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: STARD 2015 flow diagram.\n\n\n\nBy providing the exact number of participants at each stage of the study, including the number of true-positive, false-positive, true-negative and false-negative index test results, the diagram also helps identifying the correct denominator for calculating proportions such as sensitivity and specificity. The diagram should also specify the number of participants that were assessed for eligibility, the number of participants who did not receive either the index test and/or the reference standard and the reasons for that. This helps readers to judge the risk of bias, but also the feasibility of the evaluated testing strategy, and the applicability of the study findings.\nIn the example, the authors very briefly described the flow of participants, and referred to a flow diagram in which the number of participants and corresponding test results at each stage of the study were provided, as well as detailed reasons for excluding participants (Figure 2).",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nSince a diagnostic accuracy study describes the behaviour of a test under particular circumstances, a report of the study must include a complete description of the criteria that were used to identify eligible participants. Eligibility criteria are usually related to the nature and stage of the target condition and the intended future use of the index test; they often include the signs, symptoms or previous test results that generate the suspicion about the target condition. Additional criteria can be used to exclude participants for reasons of safety, feasibility and ethical arguments.\nExcluding patients with a specific condition or receiving a specific treatment known to adversely affect the way the test works can lead to inflated diagnostic accuracy estimates.1 An example is the exclusion of patients using β blockers in studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of exercise ECG.\nSome studies have one set of eligibility criteria for all study participants; these are sometimes referred to as single-gate or cohort studies. Other studies have one set of eligibility criteria for participants with the target condition, and (an)other set(s) of eligibility criteria for those without the target condition; these are called multiple-gate or case–control studies.2\nIn the first example, the eligibility criteria list presenting signs and symptoms, an age limit and exclusion based on specific conditions and treatments. Since the same set of eligibility criteria applies to all study participants, this is an example of a single-gate study.\nIn the second example, the authors used different eligibility criteria for participants with and without the target condition: one group consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Clostridium difficile, and one group consisted of healthy controls. This is an example of a multiple-gate study. Extreme contrasts between severe cases and healthy controls can lead to inflated estimates of accuracy.34",

    "text": "Explanation\nMultiple measures of diagnostic accuracy exist to describe the performance of a medical test, and their calculation from the collected data is not always straightforward.1 Authors should report the methods used for calculating the measures that they considered appropriate for their study objectives.\nStatistical techniques can be used to test specific hypotheses, following from the study's objectives. In single-test evaluations, authors may want to evaluate if the diagnostic accuracy of the tests exceeds a prespecified level (eg, sensitivity of at least 95%, see Item 4).\nDiagnostic accuracy studies can also compare two or more index tests. In such comparisons, statistical hypothesis testing usually involves assessing the superiority of one test over another, or the non-inferiority.2 For such comparisons, authors should indicate what measure they specified to make the comparison; these should match their study objectives, and the purpose and role of the index test relative to the clinical pathway. Examples are the relative sensitivity, the absolute gain in sensitivity and the relative diagnostic OR.3\nIn the example, the authors used McNemar's test statistic to evaluate whether the sensitivity and specificity of stereoscopic digital mammography differed from that of digital mammography in patients with elevated risk for breast cancer. In itself, the resulting p value is not a quantitative expression of the relative accuracy of the two investigated tests. Like any p value, it is influenced by the magnitude of the difference in effect and the sample size. In the example, the authors could have calculated the relative or absolute difference in sensitivity and specificity, including a 95% CI that takes into account the paired nature of the data.",

Structured abstracts, with separate headings for objectives, methods, results and interpretation, allow readers to find essential information more easily.3\nBuilding on STARD 2015, the newly developed STARD for Abstracts provides a list of essential items that should be included in journal and conference abstracts of diagnostic accuracy studies.",

Following research ethics board approval, recruitment was conducted via e-mail to class listservs. Participant responses were sent directly to the research assistant, who was unknown to participants, so that the principal investigators did not know who did or did not participate. This process was engaged to protect participants’ anonymity and to avoid any impression of coercion because the lead researcher (SG) was involved in the administration of the undergraduate curriculum at the time. Sample size was estimated to be sufficient based on the principle of theoretical saturation [REF] and our previous experience with this methodology (i.e., with a relatively homogeneous population, we expected to reach saturation with approximately 15 interviews per group). There were no exclusion criteria and we accepted the first 15 students from each class who volunteered.",

Observations of the patient-led teaching encounter may have illuminated an understanding of the relationship between patient instructors and medical students. Another limitation is that the PI-led teaching is optional rather than mandatory, which may have influenced students’ attitudes in a positive direction. Moreover, students who are eager to take on extra-curricular activities may not be representative of the whole population. That only 23 out of 39 students signed up for this study might also have influenced results if the missing group of students represented other perceptions than those present in the focus groups. However the received data from the focus groups were rich in information and diverse perceptions were present. Another limitation is the overrepresentation of women over men in our sample. Even though women are also overrepresented in medical school this might potentially have influenced results, but gender differences in perceptions were nevertheless not identified in the data.",

A constant comparative analysis of emergent themes was conducted.Results: Residents viewed clinical teaching assessment (CTA) as a time-consuming task with little reward. They reported struggling throughout the academic year to meet their CTA obligations and described several shortcut strategies they used to reduce their burden. Rather than conceptualizing their assessments as a conduit for both formative and summative feedback, residents perceived CTA as useful for the surveillance of clinical supervisors at the extremes of the spectrum of teaching effectiveness. They put the most effort, including the crafting of written comments, into the CTAs of these outliers. Trainees desired greater transparency in the CTA process and were sceptical regarding the anonymity and perceived validity of their faculty appraisals.Conclusions: Individual and system-based factors conspire to influence postgraduate medical trainees’ motivation for generating high-quality appraisals of clinical teaching. Academic centers need to address these factors if they want to maximize the usefulness of these assessments.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nAlthough often not called out with a specific subheading, the ‘summary’ of a report on healthcare improvement most often introduces and frames the ‘discussion’ section. While the first paragraph should be a focused summary of the most critical findings, the majority of the project’s results should be contained in the results section. The goal of the summary is to capture the major findings and bridge the discussion to a more nuanced exploration of those findings. Exactly where the summary section ends is far less important that how it sets up the reader to explore and reflect on the ensuing discussion.\nThe example below gives a clear and concise statement of the study’s strengths and distinctive features. This summary recaps quantitative findings (families called METs relatively infrequently and fewer of their calls resulted in intensive care unit (ICU) transfers), and introduces a subsequent discussion of concerns identified by families which might not be visible to clinicians, including ways in which ‘family activation of an MET may improve care without reducing MET-preventable codes outside of the ICU’.1 This conveys an important message and bridges to a discussion of the existing literature and terminology. Providing a focused summary in place of an exhaustive re-statement of project results appropriately introduces the reader to the discussion section and a more thorough description of the study’s findings and implications.\nThe authors go on to relate these main findings back to the nature and significance of the problem and the specific aims previously outlined in the introduction section, specifically (emphasis added) ’To evaluate the burden of family activation on the clinicians involved\\…too better understand the outcome of METs, and to begin to understand why families call METs’.1\nAnother approach in structuring the summary component of the discussion is to succinctly link results to the relevant processes in the development of the associated interventions. This approach is illustrated by Beckett et al in a recent paper about decreasing cardiac arrests in the acute hospital setting,2 “Key to this success has been the development of a structured response to the deteriorating patient. Following the implementation of reliable EWS (early warning systems) across the AAU(Acute Admissions Unit) and ED (Emergency Department), and the recognition and response checklists, plus weekly safety meetings in the AAU at SRI(Stirling Royal Infirmary), there was an immediate fall in the number of cardiac arrests, which was sustained thereafter.”2 This linkage serves to reintroduce the reader to some of the relevant contextual elements which can subsequently be discussed in more detail as appropriate. Importantly, it also serves to frame the interpretive section of the discussion which focuses on comparison of results with findings from other publications, and further evaluating the project’s impact.",

    "text": "Example\n\nIn our 6-year experience with family-activated METs(Medical Emergency Teams), families uncommonly activated METs. In the most recent and highest-volume year, families called 2.3 times per month on average. As a way of comparison, the hospital had an average of 8.7 accidental code team activations per month over this time. This required an urgent response from the larger team. Family activation less commonly resulted in ICU transfer than clinician activated METs, although 24% of calls did result in transfers. This represents a subset of deteriorating patients that the clinical team may have missed. In both family-activated and clinician-activated MET calls, clinical deterioration was a common cause of MET calls. Families more consistently identified their fear that the child’s safety was at risk, a lack of response from the clinical team, and that the interaction between team and family had become dismissive. To our knowledge, this study is the largest study of family-activated METs to date, both in terms of count of calls and length of time observed. It is also the first to compare reasons for MET calls from families with matched clinician-activated calls.1",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe specific aim of a project describes why it was conducted, and the goal of the report. It is essential to state the aims of improvement work clearly, completely and precisely. Specific aims should align with the nature and significance of the problem, the gap in quality, safety and value identified in the introduction, and reflect the rationale for the intervention(s). The example given makes it clear that the goal of this multisite initiative was to improve or reduce postoperative respiratory failure by using a virtual breakthrough series.\nWhen appropriate, the specific aims section of a report about healthcare improvement work should state that both process and outcomes will be assessed. Focusing only on assessment of outcomes ignores the possibility that clinicians may not have adopted the desired practice, or did not adopt it effectively, during the study period. Changing care delivery is the foundation of improvement work and should also be measured and reported. In the subsequent methods section, the example presented here also describes the process measures used to evaluate the VBS.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe introduction section of a quality improvement article clearly identifies the current relevant evidence, the best practice standard based on the current evidence and the gap in quality. A quality gap describes the difference between practice at the local level and the achievable evidence-based standard. The authors of this article describe the problem and identify the quality gap by stating that “Examination of a 10-month sample revealed only 63% of the patients received antibiotics within 60 minutes of arrival and that the benchmark of &lt;60 minutes and that delays in delivering antibiotics led to poorer outcomes.”1 The timing of antibiotic administration at the national level compared with the local level provides an achievable standard of care, which helps the authors determine the goal for their antibiotic administration improvement project.\nProviding a summary of the relevant evidence and what is known about the problem provides background and support for the improvement project and increases the likelihood for sustainable success. The contextual information provided by describing the local system clarifies the project and reflects upon how suboptimal care with antibiotic administration negatively impacts quality. Missed diagnoses, delayed treatments, increased morbidity and increased costs are associated with a lack of quality, having relevance and implications at both the local and national levels.\nImprovement work can also be done on a national or regional level. In this case, the term ‘local’ in the SQUIRE guidelines should be interpreted more generally as the specific problem to be addressed. For example, Murphy et al describe a national initiative addressing a healthcare quality issue.2 The introduction section in this article also illuminates current relevant evidence, best practice based on the current evidence, and the gap in quality. However, the quality gap reported here is the difference in knowledge of statin use for patients at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Ireland compared with European clinical guidelines: “Despite strong evidence and clinical guidelines recommending the use of statins for secondary prevention, a gap exists between guidelines and practice … A policy response that strengthens secondary prevention, and improves risk assessment and shared decision-making in the primary prevention of CVD (cardiovascular disease) is required.”2\nImprovement work can also address a gap in knowledge, rather than quality. For example, work might be done to develop tools to assess patient experience for quality improvement purposes.3 Interventions to improve patient experience, or to enhance team communication about patient safety4 may also address quality problems, but in the absence of an established, evidence-based standard.",

    "text": "Explanation\nStudies of healthcare improvement should document both planned and actual changes to the structure and/or process of care, and the resulting intended and/or unintended (desired or undesired) changes in the outcome(s) of interest.1 While measurement is inherently reductionistic, those evaluating the work can provide a rich view by combining multiple perspectives through measures of clinical, functional, experiential, and cost outcome dimensions.2\nMeasures may be routinely used to assess healthcare processes or designed specifically to characterise the application of the intervention in the clinical process. Either way, evaluators also need to consider the influence of contextual factors on the improvement effort and its outcomes.34 5 This can be accomplished through a mixed method design which combines data from quantitative measurement, qualitative interviews and ethnographical observation.6 In the study described above, triangulation of complementary data sources offers a rich picture of the phenomena under study, and strengthens confidence in the inferences drawn.\nThe choice of measures and type of data used will depend on the particular nature of the initiative under study, on data availability, feasibility considerations and resource constraints. The trustworthiness of the study will benefit from insightful reporting of the choice of measures and the rationale for choosing them. For example, in assessing ‘staff morale, attitudes, and aspects of ’culture’ that might be affected’ by the SPI1, the evaluators selected the 11 most relevant of the 28 survey questions in the NHS Staff Survey questionnaire and provided references to detailed documentation for that instrument. To assess patient safety, the authors’ approach to reviewing case notes ‘was both explicit (criterion based) and implicit (holistic) because each method identifies a different spectrum of errors’.7\nIdeally, measures would be perfectly valid, reliable, and employed in research with complete and accurate data. In practice, such perfection is impossible.8 Readers will benefit from reports of the methods employed for assessing the completeness and accuracy of data, so they can critically appraise the data and the inferences made from it.",

    "text": "Explanation\nIn the same way that reports of basic science experiments provide precise details about the quantity, specifications and usage of reagents, equipment, chemicals and materials needed to run an experiment, so too should the description of the healthcare improvement intervention include or reference enough detail that others could reproduce it. Improvement efforts are rarely unimodal and descriptions of each component of the intervention should be included. For additional guidance regarding the reporting of interventions, readers are encouraged to review the TIDieR guidelines: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24609605.\n In the first example below1 about the multisite I-PASS study to improve paediatric handoff safety, the authors describe seven different elements of the intervention, including a standardised mnemonic, several educational programmes, a faculty development programme, observation/feedback tools and even the publicity materials used to promote the intervention. Every change that could have contributed to the observed outcome is noted. Each element is briefly described and a reference to a more detailed description provided so that interested readers can seek more information. In this fashion, complete information about the intervention is made available, yet the full details do not overwhelm this report. Note that not all references are to peer-reviewed literature as some are to curricular materials in the website MedEd Portal (https://www.mededportal.org), and others are to online materials.\nThe online supplementary appendix available with this report summarises key elements of each component which is another option to make details available to readers. The authors were careful to note situations in which the intervention differed across sites. At two sites the written handoff tool was built into word-processing programmes, not the electronic medical record. Since interventions are often unevenly applied or taken up, variation in the application of intervention components across units, sites or clinicians is reported in this section where applicable.\nThe characteristics of the team that conducted the intervention (for instance, type and level of training, degree of experience, and administrative and/or academic position of the personnel leading workshops) and/or the personnel to whom the intervention was applied should be specified. Often the influence of the people involved in the project is as great as the project components themselves. The second example below,2 from an elegant study of the Hawthorne effect on hand hygiene rates, succinctly describes both the staff that were being studied and characteristics of the intervention personnel: the auditors tracking hand hygiene rates.",

The I-PASS Handoff Bundle included the following seven elements: the I-PASS mnemonic, which served as an anchoring component for oral and written handoffs and all aspects of the curriculum; a 2-hour workshop (to teach TeamSTEPPS teamwork and communication skills, as well as I-PASS handoff techniques), which was highly rated; a 1-hour role-playing and simulation session for practicing skills from the workshop; a computer module to allow for independent learning; a faculty development program; direct-observation tools used by faculty to provide feedback to residents; and a process-change and culture-change campaign, which included a logo, posters, and other materials to ensure program adoption and sustainability. A detailed description of all curricular elements and the I-PASS mnemonic have been published elsewhere and are provided in online supplementary appendix table, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. I-PASS is copyrighted by Boston Children’s Hospital, but all materials are freely available.\nEach site integrated the I-PASS structure into oral and written handoff processes; an oral handoff and a written handoff were expected for every patient. Written handoff tools with a standardized I-PASS format were built into the electronic medical record programs (at seven sites) or word-processing programs (at two sites). Each site also maintained an implementation log that was reviewed regularly to ensure adherence to each component of the handoff program.1\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\nAll HCWs (healthcare workers) on the study units, including physicians, nurses and allied health professionals, were invited to participate in the overall study of the RTLS (real-time location system) through presentations by study personnel. Posters describing the RTLS and the study were also displayed on the participating units… Auditors wore white lab coats as per usual hospital practice and were not specifically identified as auditors but may have been recognisable to some HCWs.

A systematic approach to scheduling processes, timely rescheduling of patients who missed appointments and monitoring of attendance resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients who met the CFF national recommendation of four or more visits per year.1\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the increase in the percentage of patients with greater than 25th centile for BMI/W-L from 80% to 82% might seem small, it represents a positive impact on a few more patients and provides more opportunities for improvement. Our data are in agreement with Johnson et al. (2003), who reported that frequent monitoring among other interventions made possible due to patients being seen more in clinic was associated with improved outcomes in CF.1\n\n\n\n\nWe learned that families are eager to have input and be involved…participation in the(learning and leadership collaborative) resulted in a positive culture change at the ACH CF Care Center regarding the use of QI methods.1\n\n\n\n\nWe noticed our clinic attendance started to improve before the(intervention) processes were fully implemented. We speculate this was due to the heightened awareness of our efforts by patients, families and our CF team.1\n\n\n\n\nReplication of these processes could be hindered by lack of personnel, lack of buy-in by the hospital administration and lack of patient/family involvement….barriers to attendance included rising fuel costs, transportation limitations, child care issues, missed workdays by caregivers and average low-income population.1\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\nThe direct involvement of patients and families…allowed us to address the social and medical barriers to adherence. Their input was invaluable since they live with the treatment burden that is a daily part of CF care…the in-clinic patient demonstration gave staff the ability to upgrade or replace equipment that was not functioning.2\n\n\nWe found that following a simple algorithm helped to maintain consistency in our program…the simplicity of this program makes it easily incorporated into routine CF clinic visits.2",

The authors also offer alternative explanations for outcomes, including factors which might have confounded the asserted relationship between intervention and outcome— namely that performance on the primary outcome began to improve well before implementation of the intervention. This provides insight into what the actual drivers of the outcome might have been, and can be very helpful to others seeking to replicate or modify the intervention. Finally, their comparison of their results to that of a similar study provides a basis for considerations of feasibility, sustainability, spread and replication of the intervention.\nThe second example, from Zanni, et al2 found that the simplicity of their intervention could maximise ease of implementation, suggesting that costs and trade-offs are likely to be minimal for replication in similar contexts. Conversely, Berlinksi et al1 cite barriers to replicating and sustaining their work, including staffing, leadership, population socioeconomic characteristics and informatics issues, each of which could present cost or trade-off considerations that leadership will need to consider to support implementation and sustainability. Additionally, both Berlinski et al and Zanni, et al observe that patient and family involvement in the planning and intervention process simultaneously improved the context and effectiveness of the intervention.",

The example given highlights key ethical issues that may be reported by authors, including whether or not independent review occurred, and any potential conflicts of interest.1 These issues are directly described in the quoted sections.\nExpectations for the ethical review of research and improvement work vary between countries2 and may also vary between institutions. At some institutions, both quality improvement and human subject research are reviewed using the same mechanism. Other institutions designate separate review mechanisms for human subject research and quality improvement work.3 In the example below, from the UK, Hands et al4 report that the improvement activity described was reviewed and approved by a regional research ethics committee. In another example, from the USA, the authors of a report describing a hospital-wide improvement activity to increase the rate of influenza vaccinations indicate that their work was reviewed by the facility’s quality management office.5\nAvoiding potential conflict of interest is as important in improvement work as it is in research. The authors in the example paper indicate the presence or absence of potential conflicts of interests, under the heading, ‘Competing Interests.’ Here, the authors provide the reader with clear and detailed information concerning any potential conflict of information.\nBoth the original and SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines stipulate that reports of interventions to improve the safety, value or quality of healthcare should explicitly describe how potential ethical concerns were reviewed and addressed in development and implementation of the intervention. This is an essential step for ensuring the integrity of efforts to improve healthcare, and should therefore be explicitly described in published reports.",

    "text": "Explanation\nOne of the challenges in reporting healthcare improvement studies is the effect of context on the success or failure of the intervention(s). The most commonly reported contextual elements that may interact with interventions are structural variables including organisational/practice type, volume, payer mix, electronic health record use and geographical location. Other contextual elements associated with healthcare improvement success include top management leadership, organisational structure, data infrastructure/information technology, physician involvement in activities, motivation to change and team leadership.1 In this example, the authors provided descriptive information about the structural elements of the individual practices, including type of practice, payer mix, geographical setting and use of electronic health records. The authors noted variability in improvement in diabetes and asthma measures across the practices, and examined how characteristics of practice leadership affected the change process for an initiative to improve diabetes and asthma care. Practice leadership was measured monthly by the community based practice coach at each site. For analyses, these scores were reduced into low (0–1) and high (2–3) groups. Practice change ratings were also assigned by the practice coaches indicating the degree of implementation and use of patient registries, care templates, protocols and patient self-management support tools. Local leadership showed no association with most of the clinical measures; however, local leadership involvement was significantly associated with implementation of the process tools used to improve outcomes. The authors use tables to display these associations clearly to the reader.\nIn addition, the authors use the information from the coaches’ ratings to further explore this concept of practice leadership. The authors conducted semistructured focus group interviews for a sample of 12 of the 76 practices based on improvement in clinical measures and improvement in practice change score. Two focus groups were conducted in each practice including one with practice clinicians and administrators and one with front-line staff. Three themes emerged from these interviews that explicated the concept of practice leadership in these groups. While two of the themes reflect contextual elements that are often cited in the literature (visionary leader and engaged team), the authors addressed an unexpected theme about the role of the middle (operational) manager. This operational leader was often reported to be a nurse or nurse practitioner with daily interactions with physicians and staff, who appeared to be influential in facilitating change. The level of detail provided about the specifics of practice leadership can be useful to readers who are engaged in their own improvement work. Although no harms or failures related to the work were described, transparent reporting of negative results is as important as reporting successful ones.\nIn this example, the authors used a mixed methods approach in which practice leadership and engagement was quantitatively rated by improvement coaches as well as qualitatively evaluated using focus groups. The use of qualitative methods enhanced understanding of the context of practice leadership. This mixed methods approach is not a requirement for healthcare improvement studies as the influence of contextual elements can be assessed in many ways. For example, Cohen et al simply describe the probable impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on their work to increase influenza vaccination rates in hospitalised patients,2 providing important contextual information to assist the reader’s understanding of the results.",

    "text": "Example\n\nQuantitative results\nIn terms of QI efforts, two-thirds of the 76 practices (67%) focused on diabetes and the rest focused on asthma. Forty-two percent of practices were family medicine practices, 26% were pediatrics, and 13% were internal medicine. The median percent of patients covered by Medicaid and with no insurance was 20% and 4%, respectively. One-half of the practices were located in rural settings and one-half used electronic health records. For each diabetes or asthma measure, between 50% and 78% of practices showed improvement (ie, a positive trend) in the first year.\nTables 2 and 3 show the associations of leadership with clinical measures and with practice change scores for implementation of various tools, respectively. Leadership was significantly associated with only 1 clinical measure, the proportion of patients having nephropathy screening (OR=1.37: 95% CI 1.08 to 1.74). Inclusion of practice engagement reduced these odds, but the association remained significant. The odds of making practice changes were greater for practices with higher leadership scores at any given time (ORs=1.92–6.78). Inclusion of practice engagement, which was also significantly associated with making practice changes, reduced these odds (ORs=2.41 to 4.20), but the association remained significant for all changes except for registry implementation\nQualitative results\nAmong the 12 practices interviewed, 5 practices had 3 or fewer clinicians and 7 had 4 or more (range=1–32). Seven practices had high ratings of practice change by the coach. One-half were NCQA (National Committee for Quality Assurance) certified as a patient-centered medical home. These practices were similar to the quantitative analysis sample except for higher rates of electronic health record use and Community Care of North Carolina Medicaid membership…\nLeadership-related themes from the focus groups included having (1) someone with a vision about the importance of the work, (2) a middle manager who implemented the vision, and (3) a team who believed in and were engaged in the work….Although the practice management provided the vision for change, patterns emerged among the practices that suggested leaders with a vision are a necessary, but not sufficient condition for successful implementation.\nLeading from the middle\nAll practices had leaders who initiated the change, but practices with high and low practice change ratings reported very different ‘operational’ leaders. Operational leaders in practices with low practice change ratings were generally the same clinicians, practice managers, or both who introduced the change. In contrast, in practices with high practice change ratings, implementation was led by someone other than the lead physician or top manager..”3",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nVarious types of problems addressed by healthcare improvement efforts may make certain types of solutions more or less effective. Not every problem can be solved with one method—-yet a problem often suggests its own best solution strategy. Similarly, the analytical strategy described in a report should align with the rationale, project aims and data constraints. Many approaches are available to help analyse healthcare improvement, including qualitative approaches (eg, fishbone diagrams in root cause analysis, structured interviews with patients/families, Gemba walks) or quantitative approaches (eg, time series analysis, traditional parametrical and non-parametrical testing between groups, logistic regression). Often the most effective analytical approach occurs when quantitative and qualitative data are used together. Examples of this might include value stream mapping where a process is graphically outlined with quantitative cycle times denoted; or a spaghetti map linking geography to quantitative physical movements; or annotations on a statistical process control (SPC) chart to allow for temporal insights between time series data and changes in system contexts.\nIn the first example by Brady et al,1 family activated medical emergency teams (MET) are evaluated. The combination of three methods—statistical process control, a Pareto chart and χ2 testing—makes for an effective and efficient analysis. The choice of analytical methods is described clearly and concisely. The reader knows what to expect in the results sections and why these methods were chosen. The selection of control charts gives statistically sound control limits that capture variation over time. The control limits give expected limits for natural variation, whereas statistically based rules make clear any special cause variation. This analytical methodology is strongly suited for both the prospective monitoring of healthcare improvement work as well as the subsequent reporting as a scientific paper. Depending on the type of intervention under scrutiny, complementary types of analyses may be used, including qualitative methods.\nThe MET analysis also uses a Pareto chart to analyse differences in characteristics between clinician-initiated versus family initiated MET activations. Finally, specific comparisons between subgroups, where time is not an essential variable, are augmented with traditional biostatistical approaches, such as χ2 testing. This example, with its one-paragraph description of analytical methods (control charts, Pareto charts and basic biostatistics) is easily understandable and clearly written so that it is accessible to front-line healthcare professionals who might wish to use similar techniques in their work.\nEvery analytical method also has constraints, and the reason for choosing each method should be explained by authors. The second example, by Timmerman et al,2 presents a more complex analysis of the data processes involved in a multicentre improvement collaborative. The authors provide a clear rationale for selecting each of their chosen approaches. Principles of healthcare improvement analytics are turned inwards to understand more deeply the strengths and weaknesses of the way in which primary data were obtained, rather than interpretation of the clinical data itself. In this example,2 rational subgrouping of participating sites is undertaken to understand how individual sites contribute to variation in the process and outcome measures of the collaborative. Control charts have inherent constraints, such as the requisite number of baseline data points needed to establish preliminary control limits. Recognising this, Timmerman, et al used linear regression to test for the statistical significance in the slopes of aggregate data, and used run charts for graphical representation of the data to enhance understanding.\nDonabedian said, “Measurement in the classical sense—implying precision in quantification—cannot reasonably be expected for such a complex and abstract object as quality.”3 In contrast to the what, when and how much of quantitative, empirical approaches to data, qualitative analytical methods strive to illuminate the how and why of behaviour and decision making—be it of individuals or complex systems. In the third example, by Dainty et al, grounded theory is applied to improvement work wherein the data from structured interviews are used to gain insight into and generate hypotheses about the causative or moderating forces in multicentre quality improvement collaboratives, including how they contribute to actual improvement. Themes were elicited using multiple qualitative methods—including a structured interview process, audiotaping with independent transcription, comparison of analyses by multiple investigators, and recurrence frequencies of constructs.3\nIn all three example papers, the analytical methods selected are clearly described and appropriately cited, affording readers the ability to understand them in greater detail if desired. In the first two, SPC methods are employed in divergent ways that are instructive regarding the versatility of this analytical method. All three examples provide a level of detail which further supports replication.",

    "text": "Examples\n\nExample 1\n\nWe used statistical process control with our primary process measure of family activated METs (Medical Emergency Teams) displayed on a u-chart. We used established rules for differentiating special versus common cause variation for this chart. We next calculated the proportion of family-activated versus clinician-activated METs which was associated with transfer to the ICU within 4 h of activation. We compared these proportions using χ2 tests.1\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\nThe CDMC (Saskatchewan Chronic Disease Management Collaborative) did not establish a stable baseline upon which to test improvement; therefore, we used line graphs to examine variation occurring at the aggregate level (data for all practices combined) and linear regression analysis to test for statistically significant slope (alpha=0.05). We used small multiples, rational ordering and rational subgrouping to examine differences in the level and rate of improvement between practices.\nWe examined line graphs for each measure at the practice level using a graphical analysis technique called small multiples. Small multiples repeat the same graphical design structure for each ‘slice’ of the data; in this case, we examined the same measure, plotted on the same scale, for all 33 practices simultaneously in one graphic. The constant design allowed us to focus on patterns in the data, rather than the details of the graphs. Analysis of this chart was subjective; the authors examined it visually and noted, as a group, any qualitative differences and unusual patterns.\nTo examine these patterns quantitatively, we used a rational subgrouping chart to plot the average month to month improvement for each practice on an Xbar-S chart.2\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\nKey informant interviews were conducted with staff from 12 community hospital ICUs that participated in a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) of a QI intervention using a collaborative approach. Data analysis followed the standard procedure for grounded theory. Analyses were conducted using a constant comparative approach. A coding framework was developed by the lead investigator and compared with a secondary analysis by a coinvestigator to ensure logic and breadth. As there was close agreement for the basic themes and coding decisions, all interviews were then coded to determine recurrent themes and the relationships between themes. In addition, ‘deviant’ or ‘negative’ cases (events or themes that ran counter to emerging propositions) were noted. To ensure that the analyses were systematic and valid, several common qualitative techniques were employed including consistent use of the interview guide, audiotaping and independent transcription of the interview data, double coding and analysis of the data and triangulation of investigator memos to track the course of analytic decisions.4",

Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical aspects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of system-level initiatives relative to their potential for harm, burden, and cost to the stakeholders. Potential harms particularly associated with efforts to improve the quality, safety, and value of healthcare services include opportunity costs, invasion of privacy, and staff distress resulting from disclosure of poor performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralizability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likelihood that the intervention(s) in a particular report would produce similar results in other settings, situations, or environments (also referred to as external validity). Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny systematic effort intended to raise the quality, safety, and value of healthcare services, usually done at the system level.

Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal validity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrable, credible evidence for efficacy (meaningful impact or change) resulting from introduction of a specific intervention into a particular healthcare system. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterventions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific activities and tools introduced into a healthcare system with the aim of changing its performance for the better. Complete description of an intervention includes its inputs, internal activities, and outputs (in the form of a logic model, for example), and the mechanism(s) by which these components are expected to produce changes in a system’s performance. Source #TODO check matches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of the ability to perform other tasks or meet other responsibilities resulting from the diversion of resources needed to introduce, test, or sustain a particular improvement initiative. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaningful disruption, failure, inadequacy, distress, confusion or other dysfunction in a healthcare service delivery system that adversely affects patients, staff, or the system as a whole, or that prevents care from reaching its full potential. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe routines and other activities through which healthcare services are delivered.

Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interrelated structures, people, processes, and activities that together create healthcare services for and with individual patients and populations. For example, systems exist from the personal self-care system of a patient, to the individual provider-patient dyad system, to the microsystem, to the macrosystem, and all the way to the market/social/insurance system. These levels are nested within each other. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny “reason-giving” account that asserts causal relationships between variables (causal theory) or that makes sense of an otherwise obscure process or situation (explanatory theory). Theories come in many forms, and serve different purposes in the phases of improvement work. It is important to be explicit and well-founded about any informal and formal theory (or theories) that are used. Source",

Terms such as “review,” “literature review,” “evidence synthesis,” or “knowledge synthesis” are not recommended because they do not distinguish systematic and non-systematic approaches. We also discourage using the terms “systematic review” and “meta-analysis” interchangeably because a systematic review refers to the entire set of processes used to identify, select, and synthesise evidence, whereas meta-analysis refers only to the statistical synthesis. Furthermore, a meta-analysis can be done outside the context of a systematic review (for example, when researchers meta-analyse results from a limited set of studies that they have conducted).",

    "section": "Meta-analysis and its extensions",
    "text": "Meta-analysis and its extensions\nMeta-analysis is a statistical technique used to synthesise results when study effect estimates and their variances are available, yielding a quantitative summary of results.3 The method facilitates interpretation that would otherwise be difficult to achieve if, for example, a narrative summary of each result was presented, particularly as the number of studies increases. Furthermore, meta-analysis increases the chance of detecting a clinically important effect as statistically significant, if it exists, and increases the precision of the estimated effect.11\n\nMeta-analysis models and methods\nThe summary estimate is a weighted average of the study effect estimates, where the study weights are determined primarily by the meta-analysis model. The two most common meta-analysis models are the “fixed-effect” and “random-effects” models.3 The assumption underlying the fixed-effect model is that there is one true (common) intervention effect and that the observed differences in results across studies reflect random variation only. This model is sometimes referred to as the “common-effects” or “equal-effects” model.3 A fixed-effect model can also be interpreted under a different assumption, that the true intervention effects are different and unrelated. This model is referred to as the “fixed-effects” model.12 The random-effects model assumes that there is not one true intervention effect but, rather, a distribution of true intervention effects and that the observed differences in results across studies reflect real differences in the effects of an intervention.11 The random-effects and fixed-effects models are similar in that they assume the true intervention effects are different, but they differ in that the random-effects model assumes the effects are related through a distribution, whereas the fixed-effects model does not make this assumption.\nMany considerations may influence an author’s choice of meta-analysis model. For example, their choice may be based on the clinical and methodological diversity of the included studies and the expectation that the underlying intervention effects will differ (potentially leading to selection of a random-effects model) or concern about small-study effects (the tendency for smaller studies to show different effects to larger ones,13 potentially leading to fitting of both a random-effects and fixed-effect model). Sometimes authors select a model based on the heterogeneity statistics observed (for example, switch from a fixed-effect to a random-effects model if the I2 statistic was &gt;50%).14 However, this practice is strongly discouraged.\nThere are different methods available to assign weights in fixed-effect or random-effects meta-analyses (such as Mantel-Haenszel, inverse-variance).3 For random-effects meta-analyses, there are also different ways to estimate the between-study variance (such as DerSimonian and Laird, restricted maximum likelihood (REML)) and calculate the confidence interval for the summary effect (such as Wald-type confidence interval, Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman6). Readers are referred to Deeks et al3 for further information on how to select a particular meta-analysis model and method.\n\n\nSubgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses\nExtensions to meta-analysis, including subgroup analysis and meta-regression, are available to explore causes of variation of results across studies (that is, statistical heterogeneity).3 Subgroup analyses involve splitting studies or participant data into subgroups and comparing the effects of the subgroups. Meta-regression is an extension of subgroup analysis that allows for the effect of continuous and categorical variables to be investigated.15 Authors might use either type of analysis to explore, for example, whether the intervention effect estimate varied with different participant characteristics (such as mild versus severe disease) or intervention characteristics (such as high versus low dose of a drug).\nSensitivity analyses are undertaken to examine the robustness of findings to decisions made during the review process. This involves repeating an analysis but using different decisions from those originally made and informally comparing the findings.3 For example, sensitivity analyses might have been done to examine the impact on the meta-analysis of including results from conference abstracts that have never been published in full, including studies where most (but not all) participants were in a particular age range, including studies at high risk of bias, or using a fixed-effect versus random-effects meta-analysis model.\nSensitivity analyses differ from subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses consist of making informal comparisons between different ways of estimating the same effect, whereas subgroup analyses consist of formally undertaking a statistical comparison across the subgroups.3\n\n\nExtensions to meta-analysis that model or account for dependency\nIn most meta-analyses, effect estimates from independent studies are combined. Standard meta-analysis methods are appropriate for this situation, since an underlying assumption is that the effect estimates are independent. However, standard meta-analysis methods are not appropriate when the effect estimates are correlated. Correlated effect estimates arise when multiple effect estimates from a single study are calculated using some or all of the same participants and are included in the same meta-analysis. For example, where multiple effect estimates from a multi-arm trial are included in the same meta-analysis, or effect estimates for multiple outcomes from the same study are included. For this situation, a range of methods are available that appropriately model or account for the dependency of the effect estimates. These methods include multivariate meta-analysis,16 multilevel models,17 or robust variance estimation.18 See Lopez-Lopez for further discussion.8\nWhen study data are not amenable to meta-analysis of effect estimates, alternative statistical synthesis methods (such as calculating the median effect across studies, combining P values) or structured summaries might be used.1920 Additional guidance for reporting alternative statistical synthesis methods is available (see Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guideline21).\nRegardless of the chosen synthesis method(s), authors should provide sufficient detail such that readers are able to assess the appropriateness of the selected methods and could reproduce the reported results (with access to the data).",

A restricted maximum likelihood random-effects variance estimator was used instead of the older DerSimonian-Laird one, following recent guidance. Random-effects 95% prediction intervals were to be calculated for meta-analyses with at least three studies to aid in their interpretation by quantifying expected treatment effects in a future clinical setting. The extent and impact of between-study heterogeneity were assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calculating the tau-squared and the I-squared statistics, respectively. The 95% CIs (uncertainty intervals) around tau-squared and the I-squared were calculated to judge our confidence about these metrics. We arbitrarily adopted the I-squared thresholds of &gt;75% to be considered as signs of considerable heterogeneity, but we also judged the evidence for this heterogeneity (through the uncertainty intervals) and the localization on the forest plot…All analyses were run in Stata SE 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) by one author.”22\n\n\nExample 2: calculating the median effect across studies\n\n“We based our primary analyses upon consideration of dichotomous process adherence measures (for example, the proportion of patients managed according to evidence-based recommendations). In order to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects associated with reminders without resorting to numerous assumptions or conveying a misleading degree of confidence in the results, we used the median improvement in dichotomous process adherence measures across studies…With each study represented by a single median outcome, we calculated the median effect size and interquartile range across all included studies for that comparison.”23",

The resulting regression coefficient indicates how the outcome variable (log risk ratio (RR) for smoking cessation) changes when interventions take a socioeconomic-position-tailored versus non-socioeconomic-tailored approach. A statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) coefficient indicates that there is a linear association between the effect estimate for smoking cessation and the explanatory variable. More moderators (study-level variables) can be included in the model, which might account for part of the heterogeneity in the true effects. We pre-planned an adjusted model to include important study covariates related to the intensity and delivery of the intervention (number of sessions delivered (above median vs below median), whether interventions involved a trained smoking cessation specialist (yes vs no), and use of pharmacotherapy in the intervention group (yes vs no). These covariates were included a priori as potential confounders given that programmes tailored to socioeconomic position might include more intervention sessions or components or be delivered by different professionals with varying experience. The regression coefficient estimates how the intervention effect in the socioeconomic-position-tailored subgroup differs from the reference group of non-socioeconomic-position-tailored interventions.”5",

Presenting the key characteristics of each study in a table or figure can facilitate comparison of characteristics across the studies.1 Citing each study enables retrieval of relevant reports if desired.\nFor systematic reviews of interventions, presenting an additional table that summarises the intervention details for each study (such as using the template based on the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR)2) has several benefits. An intervention summary table helps readers compare the characteristics of the interventions and consider those that may be feasible for implementation in their setting; highlights missing or unavailable details; shows which studies did not specify certain characteristics as part of the intervention; and highlights characteristics that have not been investigated in existing studies.23",

    "text": "Explanation\nReporting the full details of all search strategies (such as the full, line by line search strategy as run in each database) should enhance the transparency of the systematic review, improve replicability, and enable a review to be more easily updated.57 Presenting only one search strategy from among several hinders readers’ ability to assess how comprehensive the searchers were and does not provide them with the opportunity to detect any errors. Furthermore, making only one search strategy available limits replication or updating of the searches in the other databases, as the search strategies would need to be reconstructed through adaptation of the one(s) made available. As well as reporting the search strategies, a description of the search strategy development process can help readers judge how far the strategy is likely to have identified all studies relevant to the review’s inclusion criteria. The description of the search strategy development process might include details of the approaches used to identify keywords, synonyms, or subject indexing terms used in the search strategies, or any processes used to validate or peer review the search strategies. Empirical evidence suggests that peer review of search strategies is associated with improvements to search strategies, leading to retrieval of additional relevant records.8 Further guidance and examples of reporting search strategies can be found in PRISMA-Search.9",

Candidate search terms were identified by looking at words in the titles, abstracts and subject indexing of those records. A draft search strategy was developed using those terms and additional search terms were identified from the results of that strategy. Search terms were also identified and checked using the PubMed PubReMiner word frequency analysis tool. The MEDLINE strategy makes use of the Cochrane RCT filter reported in the Cochrane Handbook v5.2. As per the eligibility criteria the strategy was limited to English language studies. The search strategy was validated by testing whether it could identify the five known relevant studies and also three further studies included in two systematic reviews identified as part of the strategy development process. All eight studies were identified by the search strategies in MEDLINE and Embase. The strategy was developed by an information specialist and the final strategies were peer reviewed by an experienced information specialist within our team. Peer review involved proofreading the syntax and spelling and overall structure, but did not make use of the PRESS checklist.”10",

For example, one meta-analysis might include three studies of participants aged 30 years on average, whereas another meta-analysis might include 10 studies of participants aged 60 years on average; in this case, knowing the mean age per synthesis is more meaningful than the overall mean age across all 13 studies. Providing a brief summary of the characteristics and risk of bias among studies contributing to each synthesis (meta-analysis or other) should help readers understand the applicability and risk of bias in the synthesised result. Furthermore, a summary at the level of the synthesis is more usable since it obviates the need for readers to refer to multiple sections of the review in order to interpret results.2",

Reporting results of all sensitivity analyses is important; presentation of a subset, based on the nature of the results, risks introducing bias due to selective reporting. Forest plots are a useful way to present results of sensitivity analyses; however, these may be best placed in an appendix, with the main forest plots presented in the main report, to not reduce readability. An exception may be when sensitivity analyses reveal the results are not robust to decisions made during the review process.",

Such sensitivity analyses were not performed for other outcomes because none of the studies reporting them was at a high risk of bias. Sensitivity analysis that pooled the outcome data reported at 48 weeks, which also showed consistent results, was performed for undetectable HIV-1 RNA and increase in CD4 T cell count only (supplement 3J and 3K) and not for other outcomes owing to lack of relevant data. When the standard deviations for increase in CD4 T cell count were replaced by those estimated by different methods, the results of Figure 1 either remained similar (that is, quadruple and triple arms not statistically different) or favoured triple therapies (supplement 2).”1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The figure displays for each study included in the meta-analysis the summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and sample size) for the quadruple and triple combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) groups, and the mean difference and its 95% confidence interval for the continuous outcome, CD4 T cell count (cells/μL).

    "text": "Explanation\nPresenting data from individual studies facilitates understanding of each study’s contribution to the findings and reuse of the data by others seeking to perform additional analyses or perform an update of the review. There are different ways of presenting results of individual studies (such as table, forest plot).23 Visual display of results supports interpretation by readers, while tabulation of the results makes it easier for others to reuse the data.\nDisplaying summary statistics by group is helpful, because it allows an assessment of the severity of the problem in the studies (such as level of depression symptoms), which is not available from between-group results (that is, effect estimates).4 However, there are some scenarios where presentation of simple summary statistics for each group may be misleading. For example, in the case of cluster-randomised designs, the observed number of events and sample size in each group does not reflect the effective sample size (that is, the sample size adjusted for correlation among observations). However, providing the estimated proportion of events (or another summary statistic) per group will be helpful.5 The effect estimates from models that appropriately adjust for clustering (and other design features) should be reported and included in the meta-analysis in such instances.",

    "text": "Systematic review registration and protocols\nRegistration aims to reduce bias, increase transparency, facilitate scrutiny and improve trustworthiness of systematic reviews.23 Registration also aims to reduce unintended duplication; researchers planning a new review should search register listings to identify similar completed or ongoing reviews before deciding whether their review is needed, noting that planned duplication may be justified.2\nA registration entry captures key elements of the review protocol and is submitted to a host register, ideally before starting the review. The register maintains a permanent public record of this information along with any subsequent amendments (date-stamped) and issues a unique number to link the registration entry to completed review publications.4 Publicly recording details of inclusion and exclusion criteria, planned outcomes, and syntheses enables peer reviewers, journal editors, and readers to compare the completed review with what was planned, identify any deviations, and decide whether these may have introduced bias.\nPROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) currently registers systematic reviews with direct health outcomes. It also accepts systematic reviews of animal studies that have direct implications for human health, and methodology reviews which have direct bearing on human health or systematic review conduct. Reviews not meeting the criteria for inclusion in PROSPERO could be registered elsewhere; for example, in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository. Both PROSPERO and OSF allow for registration without cost.\nA review protocol is distinct from a register entry for a review. A review protocol outlines in detail the pre-planned objectives and methods intended to be used to conduct the review, helping to anticipate/avoid potential problems before embarking on a review and providing a methodical approach to prevent arbitrary decision making during the review process.5 Systematic reviewers are encouraged to report their protocols in accordance with the PRISMA guidance for protocols (PRISMA-P).6 PRISMA-P consists of a checklist6 accompanied by a detailed guidance document providing researchers with a step-by-step approach for documenting a systematic review protocol.5\nA review protocol should be a public document in order to facilitate future purposeful replications or updates of the review and to help future users evaluate whether selective reporting and potential bias were present in the review process.5 Review protocols can be made public through one of several routes. One option is to upload a PDF of the protocol to the corresponding PROSPERO registration record so they are linked in perpetuity. Another option is to make a protocol a document with its own unique identifier (that is, a DOI) so it can be cited across various documents including the PROSPERO registration record and in the full text of the completed review. To achieve this, reviewers may opt to publish a protocol in a journal that is open access or provides free access to content (such as Systematic Reviews, BMJ Open) or a journal using the Registered Reports publishing framework (https://cos.io/rr/), where it will benefit from external feedback before publication, or deposit a protocol in a general purpose or institutional open access repository (such as Open Science Framework Registries, Zenodo).",

Examples of interventions that we did or did not deem perioperative in nature included long term preoperative drug treatment (not included, as not started and completed during the perioperative pathway) and perioperative physiotherapy interventions (included, as both started and completed during the perioperative pathway). We excluded studies in which the intervention was directly related to surgical technique.\nOutcomes: To be included, a trial had to use a defined clinical outcome relating to postoperative pulmonary complications, such as “pneumonia” diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition. Randomized controlled trials reporting solely physiological (for example, lung volumes and flow measurements) or biochemical (for example, lung inflammatory markers) outcomes are valuable but neither patient centric nor necessarily clinically relevant, and we therefore excluded them. We applied no language restrictions. Our primary outcome measure was the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, with postoperative pulmonary complications being defined as the composite of any of respiratory infection, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, atelectasis, or pneumothorax…Where a composite postoperative pulmonary complication was not reported, we contacted corresponding authors via email to request additional information, including primary data.”8",

Patients and healthcare providers may be primarily interested in the balance of benefits and harms, while policy makers and administrators may value data on organisational impact and resource utilisation. For reviews of interventions, authors might clarify trade-offs between benefits and harms and how the values attached to the most important outcomes of the review might lead different people to make different decisions. In addition, rather than making recommendations for practice or policy that apply universally, authors might discuss factors that are important in translating the evidence to different settings and factors that may modify the magnitude of effects.\nExplicit recommendations for future research—as opposed to general statements such as “More research on this question is needed”—can better direct the questions future studies should address and the methods that should be used. For example, authors might consider describing the type of understudied participants who should be enrolled in future studies, the specific interventions that could be compared, suggested outcome measures to use, and ideal study design features to employ.",

This provides important evidence of the effectiveness of mandated programs on college campuses. Additionally, the fact that our (preliminary) moderator analyses found program effects on bystander intervention to be similar for adolescents and college students suggests early implementation of bystander programs (i.e. in secondary schools with adolescents) may be warranted. Importantly, although we found that bystander programs had a significant beneficial effect on bystander intervention behaviour, we found no evidence that these programs had an effect on participants' sexual assault perpetration. Bystander programs may therefore be appropriate for targeting bystander behaviour, but may not be appropriate for targeting the behaviour of potential perpetrators. Additionally, effects of bystander programs on bystander intervention behaviour diminished by 6‐month post‐intervention. Thus, programs effects may be prolonged by the implementation of booster sessions conducted prior to 6 months post‐intervention.\nImplications for research: Findings from this review suggest there is a fairly strong body of research assessing the effects of bystander programs on attitudes and behaviours. However, there are a couple of important questions worth further exploration…Our understanding of the causal mechanisms of program effects on bystander behaviour would benefit from further analysis (e.g., path analysis mapping relationships between specific knowledge/attitude effects and bystander intervention)…Our understanding of the differential effects of gendered versus gender neutral programs would benefit from the design and implementation of high-quality primary studies that make direct comparisons between these two types of programs (e.g., RCTs comparing the effects of two active treatment arms that differ in their gendered approach)…Our understanding of bystander programs' generalizability to non-US contexts would be greatly enhanced by high quality research conducted across the world.”1",

It is important to specify the methods that were used to select the results when multiple results were available so that users are able to judge the appropriateness of those methods and whether there is potential for bias in the selection of results.\nReviewers may make changes to the inclusion or definition of the outcome domains or to the importance given to them in the review (for example, an outcome listed as “important” in the protocol is considered “critical” in the review).

The tests or diagnostic criteria used in each study should have had evidence of validity and reliability for the assessment of mild cognitive impairment, but studies were not excluded on this basis…Results could be reported as an overall test score that provides a composite measure across multiple areas of cognitive ability (i.e. global cognitive function), sub-scales that provide a measure of domain-specific cognitive function or cognitive abilities (such as processing speed, memory), or both…Studies with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were eligible, a time frame chosen to ensure that studies were designed to examine more persistent effects of alcohol consumption…No restrictions were placed on the number of points at which the outcome was measured, but the length of follow-up and number of measurement points (including a baseline measure of cognition) was considered when interpreting study findings and in deciding which outcomes were similar enough to combine for synthesis.\nWe anticipated that individual studies would report data for multiple cognitive outcomes. Specifically, a single study may report results:\n\nFor multiple constructs related to cognitive function, for example, global cognitive function and cognitive ability on specific domains (e.g. memory, attention, problem-solving, language);\nUsing multiple methods or tools to measure the same or similar outcome, for example reporting measures of global cognitive function using both the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment;\nAt multiple time points, for example, at 1, 5, and 10 years.\n\nWhere multiple cognition outcomes were reported, we selected one outcome for inclusion in analyses and for reporting the main outcomes (e.g. for GRADEing), choosing the result that provided the most complete information for analysis. Where multiple results remained, we listed all available outcomes (without results) and asked our content expert to independently rank these based on relevance to the review question, and the validity and reliability of the measures used. Measures of global cognitive function were prioritised, followed by measures of memory, then executive function. In the circumstance where results from multiple multivariable models were presented, we extracted associations from the most fully adjusted model, except in the case where an analysis adjusted for a possible intermediary along the causal pathway (i.e. post-baseline measures of prognostic factors (e.g. smoking, drug use, hypertension)).”8",

Use a format appropriate for the section of the review. For example, in text, certainty might be reported explicitly in a sentence (such as “Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) indicates that…”) or in brackets alongside an effect estimate (such as “[RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.68; 4 studies, 1781 participants; moderate certainty evidence]”). When interpreting results in “summary of findings” tables or conclusions, certainty might be communicated implicitly using standard phrases (such as “Hip protectors probably reduce the risk of hip fracture slightly”).2",

    "text": "Explanation\nSharing of data, analytic code, and other materials enables others to reuse the data, check the data for errors, attempt to reproduce the findings, and understand more about the analysis than may be provided by descriptions of methods.12 Support for sharing of data, analytic code, and other materials is growing, including from patients3 and journal editors, including BMJ and PLOS Medicine.4\nSharing of data, analytic code, and other materials relevant to a systematic review includes making various items publicly available, such as the template data collection forms; all data extracted from included studies; a file indicating necessary data conversions; the clean dataset(s) used for all analyses in a format ready for reuse (such as CSV file); metadata (such as complete descriptions of variable names, README files describing each file shared); analytic code used in software with a command-line interface or complete descriptions of the steps used in point-and-click software to run all analyses. Other materials might include more detailed information about the intervention delivered in the primary studies that are otherwise not available, such as a video of the specific cognitive behavioural therapy supplied by the study investigators to reviewers.5 Similarly, other material might include a list of all citations screened and any decisions about eligibility.\nBecause sharing of data, analytic code, and other materials is not yet universal in health and medical research,4 even interested authors may not know how to make their materials publicly available. Data, analytic code, and other materials can be uploaded to one of several publicly accessible repositories (such as Open Science Framework, Dryad, figshare). The Systematic Review Data Repository (https://srdr.ahrq.gov/) is another example of a platform for sharing materials specific to the systematic review community.6 All of these open repositories should be given consideration, particularly if the completed review is to be considered for publication in a paywalled journal. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles are also a useful resource for authors to consult,7 as they provide guidance on the best way to share information.\nThere are some situations where authors might not be able to share review materials, such as when the review team are custodians rather than owners of individual participant data, or when there are legal or licensing restrictions. For example, records exported directly from bibliographic databases (such as Ovid MEDLINE) typically include copyrighted material; authors should read the licensing terms of the databases they search to see what they can share and to consider the copyright legislation of their countries.",

Were participants recruited from primary, secondary, or tertiary healthcare, or from the community? Healthcare institutions vary greatly in their organisation, experience, and resources and the baseline risk for the condition under investigation. Other aspects of the setting, including the social, economic, and cultural environment, might also affect a study’s external validity.\nAuthors should report the number and type of settings and describe the care providers involved. They should report the locations in which the study was carried out, including the country, city if applicable, and immediate environment (eg, community, general practice, hospital outpatient clinic, or inpatient unit). In particular, it should be reported whether the trial was carried out in one site (single centre trials) or several sites (multicentre trials). The description of the setting should provide enough information so that readers can judge whether the results of the trial could be relevant to their own setting. The environment in which the trial is conducted might differ considerably from the setting in which the trial’s results are later used to guide practice and policy.3,4 Authors should also report any other information about the settings and locations that could have influenced the observed results.",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe word “design” is often used to refer to all aspects of how a trial is set up, but it also has a narrower interpretation. Many aspects of the broader trial design, including details of randomisation and blinding, are addressed elsewhere in the CONSORT checklist. This item refers to the type of trial (eg, parallel group or crossover) and the conceptual framework (eg, superiority, equivalence, or non-inferiority).\nCONSORT 2025 focuses mainly on trials with participants individually randomised to one of two parallel groups. While many published trials have such a design, the main alternative designs are multi-arm parallel,3 crossover,4 cluster,5 and factorial designs,6 with each having their own specific CONSORT extensions. A detailed review of randomised trials published in PubMed in 2012 showed that of the 1122 trials, 953 (85%) were parallel group; the other main designs were crossover (n=98; 13%) and cluster (n=31; 3%). Of these 1122 trials, 892 (80%) had two groups, 146 (13%) had three groups, and 61 (5%) had four or more groups.7\nMost trials are designed to identify the superiority of a new intervention, if it exists, but others are designed to assess non-inferiority or equivalence.8 It is important that researchers clearly describe the design of their trial, including the unit of randomisation (eg, patient, general practice, lesion). These details should also be included in the abstract (item 1b).\nIf a less common design is used, authors should explain their choice, especially as such designs may imply the need for a larger sample size or more complex analysis and interpretation. Although most trials use equal randomisation (eg, 1:1 for two groups), it is also helpful to provide the allocation ratio explicitly.",

    "text": "Explanation\nTransparent and sufficiently detailed abstracts are important because readers often base their assessment of a trial on such information. Some readers use an abstract as a screening tool to decide whether to read the full article. However, not all trials are freely available and some health professionals and other users do not have access to the full trial reports.1\nA journal abstract should contain sufficient information about a trial to serve as an accurate record of its conduct and findings, providing optimal information about the trial within the space constraints and format of a journal. A properly constructed and written abstract helps individuals to assess quickly the relevance of the findings and aids the retrieval of relevant reports from electronic databases.2 The abstract should accurately reflect what is included in the full journal article and should not include information that does not appear in the body of the paper. In addition, abstracts should not be a distorted representation of the trial results. Studies comparing information reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with, or missing from, the body of the full article.3–56 Abstracts are also frequently reported with spin defined as a distorted representation of the study results.7–9 Authors should avoid selectively reporting only statistically significant secondary outcomes or subgroup analyses. Conversely, omitting important harms from the abstract could seriously mislead interpretation of the trial findings and benefit-to-harms balance that is critical for decision making.10,11\nAn extension to CONSORT 2001 provided a list of essential items that authors should include in a journal (or conference) abstract when reporting the main results of a randomised trial.12 A systematic review of 10 meta-research studies examined the reporting quality of abstracts of randomised trials and found improvements in reporting following publication of this extension.13 Table 1 provides a list of essential items to include in an abstract; it is based on the CONSORT for Abstracts extension14 and has been updated to reflect changes made to the main CONSORT checklist. We strongly recommend the use of structured abstracts for reporting randomised trials. They provide readers with information about the trial under a series of headings pertaining to the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation.15 Some studies have found that structured abstracts offer greater value and information coverage than the more traditional descriptive abstracts1617 and allow readers to find information more easily.18 We recognise that journals have their own structure for reporting abstracts. It is not our intention to suggest changes to these formats, but to recommend what information should be reported.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Items to include when reporting a randomised trial in a journal abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nObjectives\nSpecific objectives\n\n\nTrial design\nDescription of the trial design (eg, parallel group, cluster) and framework (eg, superiority, equivalence, non-inferiority, exploratory)\n\n\nMethods\n-\n\n\nParticipants\nEligibility criteria for participants and settings where the trial was conducted\n\n\nInterventions\nIntervention(s) and comparator(s) intended for each group\n\n\nOutcome\nPrimary outcome(s)\n\n\nRandomisation\nHow participants were allocated to interventions (eg, centralised computer generated randomisation)\n\n\nBlinding\nWho was blinded after assignment to interventions (eg, participants, care providers, outcome assessors)\n\n\nResults\n-\n\n\nNumbers randomised\nNumber of participants randomised to each group\n\n\nNumbers analysed\nFor the primary outcome, number of participants analysed in each group\n\n\nOutcome\nFor the primary outcome, a result for each group and the estimated effect size and its precision\n\n\nHarms\nImportant harms or unintended events for each group\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral interpretation of the results\n\n\nTrial registration\nName of trial register and identifying number\n\n\nFunding\nSources of funding",

    "text": "Explanation\nA key strength of a randomised trial design is the avoidance of bias when randomly allocating trial participants to interventions. To preserve the benefits of randomisation, all randomised participants are included in the analysis and retained in the group to which they were allocated. Meeting these two conditions defines an intention-to-treat analysis—which is widely recommended as the preferred analysis strategy.5–7 However, strict adherence to an intention-to-treat analysis is often difficult to achieve owing to missing outcomes for some trial participants (item 21c) or non-adherence to the trial intervention protocol. While imputation of missing outcomes would allow an intention-to-treat analysis, it does not guarantee an avoidance of bias except under strong assumptions about the missing data which may be unknown.\nVarious strategies for performing intention-to-treat analyses in the presence of missing outcome data are available.8 When the number of missing outcomes is not large, the analysis population could be all randomised participants with outcome observed (known as an “available case” population) under a plausible missing data mechanism, and sensitivity analyses could be performed exploring departures from this assumption (thereby using all randomised participants at least in sensitivity analyses).8 Concerns may arise when the frequency or the causes of dropping out differ between the intervention groups. Striving for intention-to-treat analysis by imputing values for participants with missing outcomes may lead to use of inadequate methods such as last observation carried forward.8–1011\nRegardless of whether all randomised participants (completely observed outcomes or imputed outcomes) or a subset of randomised participants with observed outcomes are included in the primary analysis, the analysis population should be described. Authors often describe performing analyses on a “modified intention-to-treat” population to cover departures from a strict intention-to-treat that excludes participants who did not adequately adhere to the protocol such that they did not receive some minimum amount of the intervention—in such cases, what defines the minimum amount of the intervention should be explained (eg, those participants receiving at least one dose of the medication). It is also common to include analyses based on a per protocol population, which includes participants completing the study with no major protocol deviations. Excluding participants may compromise the randomisation and lead to biased estimates of treatment effects if appropriate methods are not used. Other analysis populations are possible (eg, a safety population), and their rationale and definition should be explained. Thus, authors should clearly define which participants are included in each analysis and in which intervention group and avoid terms such as “modified intention-to-treat” or “per protocol” analysis.",

Multiple imputation was performed using the fully conditional specification approach with 5 imputed data sets and results combined using the Rubin rules (eMethods in Supplement 2). Other prespecified sensitivity analyses examined the effect of imbalances in baseline participant characteristics using multiple logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs [confidence intervals] for point prevalence abstinence at 12 and 24 weeks, adjusting for characteristics for which the absolute value of the standardized difference was 0.1 or greater. We conducted additional post hoc analyses: (1) to examine potential clustering by site using generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for site to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs for point prevalence abstinence at 12 and 24 weeks, and (2) to compare the baseline characteristics of participants with self-reported smoking data at 12 weeks (primary end point) with those of participants without self-reported smoking data. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute).”1\n“Several prespecified sensitivity analyses were done. First, assessment of the effect of missing data on the primary outcome was done using multiple imputation by chained equations method (MICE). This imputation model included all the variables in the primary ITT [intention to treat] analysis, secondary outcomes (from each timepoint), and baseline variables associated with the missingness of the primary outcome. 20 imputed datasets were generated and combined using Rubin’s rules, and the primary analysis model was then repeated using the imputed data. We specified a priori the following potential exploratory analyses to assess effect modification on the primary outcome: baseline hypertension, baseline MMSE [Mini-Mental State Examination], baseline age, time since Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, baseline brain volume, and change in systolic blood pressure. A post-hoc analysis was also done to investigate for differences between aggregated and disaggregated MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] data (according to MRI scanner modality) for the primary outcomes.”2\n“Four sensitivity analyses were done examining the primary outcome: restricted to women who had not received antibiotics in the 7 days before delivery, to examine whether any masking of a prophylactic effect was occurring by inclusion of pretreated women; excluding women prescribed antibiotics (other than the trial intervention) within the first 24 h after delivery, and who might therefore already have had an infection at the time of administration of the intervention; restricted to women whose primary outcome was obtained between weeks 6 and 10 after delivery to exclude any biases by over-reporting of outcomes from data returned at a later timepoint or under-reporting of outcomes in data returned at an earlier timepoint; and including centre as a random effect. No subgroup analyses were planned; however, we did a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the primary outcome according to mode of birth (forceps or vacuum extraction). More stringent 99% CIs [confidence intervals] are presented for the estimate of RR [risk ratio] for this post-hoc subgroup analysis.”3\n“A prespecified subgroup analysis for the primary outcomes, testing for an interaction for baseline anxiety, depression, and opioid use, defined using their median values was completed. Prespecified sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome, excluding participants included in process evaluation interviews, adjusting for the imbalance of death, and split by baseline pain disorders were also completed. Because of the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, findings for analyses of secondary end points should be interpreted as exploratory.

Morris and colleagues provide a principled approach to guide any sensitivity analyses by posing three questions to trialists: does the proposed sensitivity analysis address the same question as the primary analysis; is it possible for the proposed sensitivity analysis to return a different result to the primary analysis; and if the results do differ, is there any uncertainty as to which will be believed.5,6\nSubgroup analyses are another set of additional analyses that are widely carried out and reported.7–10 Here, the focus is on those analyses that look for evidence of a difference in treatment effect in complementary subgroups (eg, older and younger participants), a comparison known as a test of interaction.11 Empirical analyses of subgroup difference claims for factors such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, and other factors show selective reporting, frequent lack of proper statistical support, and poor independent corroboration.12–14\nA common but misleading approach is to compare P values for separate analyses of the treatment effect in each group. Categorising continuous variables to create subgroups is often done for simplicity and because it is perceived as easier to understand and communicate. Major limitations of the approach include the splitting of a continuous variable into discrete subgroups by arbitrarily chosen cut-off points that lack clinical or biological plausibility, which loses information, and thus reduces statistical power.15 Choosing cut-off points based on achieving statistical significance should be avoided. It is incorrect to infer a subgroup effect (interaction) from one significant (in one subgroup) and one non-significant P value (in another subgroup). The rationale for any subgroups should be outlined (including how they are defined), along with whether the subgroups were specified a priori in the protocol or statistical analysis plan or were done post hoc. Because of the high risk for spurious findings, subgroup analyses are often discouraged. Post hoc subgroup comparisons (analyses done after looking at the data) are especially likely not to be confirmed by further studies. Most of these analyses do not have substantial credibility.\nAn alternative and stronger approach, which avoids the need to specify cut-off points to assess the interaction between a continuous variable (eg, age) and treatment effect would be to fit a regression model, which can be presented graphically to examine how the estimated treatment effects varies with the level of the variable.16 These analyses are more complex, requiring model assumptions to capture the relationship (linear or non-linear) between the variable and the treatment effect. Authors should clearly describe the statistical methods used to explore the treatment-covariate interaction.",

With an estimated recruitment rate of 3 patients per month, a follow-up period for each patient of 24 months, and a percentage of patients lost to follow-up or not evaluable of 15%, 132 patients had to be randomized, and we planned to enroll a total of 66 patients per group.”1\n“The target sample size was 300 (150 per arm) over a 3-and-a-half-year recruitment period. This was based on an assumed proportion of individuals with clinically meaningful improvement in VA [visual acuity] (&gt;10 letters) of 55% in the standard care arm and a 19% increase in the adjunct group to 75%, with approximately 7% loss to follow-up, at least 90% power and two-sided 5% type 1 error.”2\n“In order to detect a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in mean volume of daily PA [physical activity] of 2.1 m g [milligravity] at 12 months, and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 5.3 m g, power of 80%, and a statistical significance level of 5%, a total of 202 participants were required. Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up and 20% non-compliance of accelerometer/intervention attendance meant that at least 338 participants were required (169 per group). The value of 2.1 m g was chosen as it represents an increase in PA that is equivalent to walking at the threshold between light intensity and moderate intensity (for example, 4 km per hour) for 30 min per day or 10–15 min of brisk walking per day.”3\n“Sample size was based on the primary outcome measure, HOS ADL [hip outcome score activities of daily living subscale] at eight months post-randomisation, and was calculated using a minimum clinically important difference between groups of 9 points. We estimated the standard deviation to be 14 points; however, summaries presented at a planned interim data monitoring meeting found that the standard deviation was 18 points.

    "text": "Explanation\nSample size calculations are a key design component for a trial and need careful planning. Sample size calculations need to balance ethical and logistical considerations alongside medical and statistical considerations so that the scientific question can be reliably and precisely answered in a timely manner without unnecessarily exposing individuals to ineffective or harmful interventions. They are generally based on one primary outcome. A trial should therefore be sufficiently large to have a high probability (power) of identifying a clinically important difference of a prespecified size that meets a criterion of statistical significance, if such a difference exists. The magnitude of the effect has an inverse relationship with the sample size required for its detection; that is, larger sample sizes are needed to detect smaller differences. Moreover, the inverse relationship is not linear: very small differences require enormous sample sizes to have good power to detect.\nAll details on how the sample size was determined should be reported to allow replication (in principle). Elements of the sample size calculation that need to be specified are the primary outcome (and time point) on which the calculation was based (item 14); the anticipated values for the outcome in each trial group (which implies the clinically important target difference between the intervention groups) at a specific time point with rationale or provenance of all quantities, including any relevant citations; or continuous outcomes, the standard deviation of the measurements5; the statistical test; the α (type I error) value and whether it is two sided; the statistical power (or the β (type II error) value); and the resulting target sample size per trial group (see the box below). Details should be given of any inflation of the sample size made for attrition or non-adherence during the study. Reference to any formulas or software packages used for the sample size calculation should all be reported. The reporting will have additional considerations for crossover trials,6 factorial trials,7 cluster trials,8 multi-arm trials,9 within-person trials,10 and non-inferiority and equivalence trials.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELTA12 recommended reporting items for the sample size calculation of a randomised controlled trial with a superiority question*13\n\n\n\n\nCore items\n\nPrimary outcome (and any other outcome on which the calculation is based).

If both an absolute and a relative difference are provided, clarify if either takes primacy in terms of the sample size calculation\nContinuous—state the target mean difference on the natural scale, common standard deviation, and standardised effect size (mean difference divided by the standard deviation)\nTime to event—state the target difference as an absolute or relative difference (or both); provide the control group event proportion, planned length of follow-up, intervention and control group survival distributions, and accrual time (if assumptions regarding these values are made).

For a time-to-event outcome, the number of events required should be stated\nIf any adjustments (eg, allowance for loss to follow-up, multiple testing) that alter the required sample size are incorporated, they should also be specified, referenced, and justified along with the final sample size\nFor alternative designs, additional input should be stated and justified\nProvide details of any assessment of the sensitivity of the sample size to the inputs used\n\n\n\n\nAdditional items for grant application and trial protocol\n\nUnderlying basis used for specifying the target difference (an important or realistic difference)\nExplain the choice of target difference—specify and reference any formal method used or relevant previous research\n\n\n\nAdditional item for trial results paper\n\nReference the trial protocol.\n\nTransparency in the sample size reveals the power of the trial to readers and gives them a measure by which to assess whether the trial attained its planned size. Any differences in the planned sample size described in the trial registration (item 2), study protocol (item 3), or statistical analysis plan should be explained.\nInterim analyses are used in some trials to help decide whether to stop early or to continue recruiting sometimes beyond the planned trial end (item 16b). If the actual sample size differed from the originally intended sample size for some other reason (eg, because of poor recruitment or revision of the target sample size), an explanation should be given alongside details of the revised sample size. Many reviews have found that few authors report how they determined the sample size.14–1920,21\nThere is no value in conducting and reporting a post hoc calculation of statistical power using the results of a trial, for example, as a pretext to explain non-significant findings; this may even mislead and confuse readers.22,23",

Medical and surgical treatments, including concurrent treatments, evolve continuously and may affect the routine care given to participants during a trial. Thus, it is important to report the periods of recruitment into the trial. Knowing the rate at which participants were recruited may also be useful, especially to other investigators.\nThe length of follow-up is not always a fixed period after randomisation. In many randomised trials in which the outcome is time to an event, follow-up of all participants is ended on a specific date. This date should be given, and it is also useful to report the minimum, maximum, and median duration of follow-up.3,4 A review of reports in oncology journals that used survival analysis, most of which were not randomised trials,4 found that nearly 80% (104 of 132 reports) included the starting and ending dates for accrual of patients, but only 24% (32 of 132 reports) also reported the date on which follow-up ended.\nInformation on the periods of recruitment and follow-up may be different for outcomes of benefits and harm.5 For example, the assessment of harms might be planned to take place during the entire study through non-systematic assessment, might occur during only part of the study duration, might occur at specific time points using systematic or non-systematic assessment, or might continue after the completion of follow-up for the main efficacy outcome. Reporting the periods of recruitment and follow-up for benefits and harms is important to allow comprehensive and accurate interpretation of the trial’s results.5",

    "text": "Explanation\nRandomisation eliminates selection bias at trial entry and is the crucial component of high quality randomised trials (box 5).3 Successful randomisation hinges on two steps: generation of an unpredictable allocation sequence and concealment of this sequence from the investigators enrolling participants (item 18).4,5\n\nTreatment allocation in trials\nThe method used to assign interventions to trial participants is a crucial aspect of clinical trial design. Random assignment is the preferred method; it has been successfully used regularly in trials for more than 75 years.6 Randomisation has three major advantages.7 Firstly, when properly implemented, it eliminates selection bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. Without randomisation, treatment comparisons may be prejudiced, whether consciously or not, by selection of participants of a particular kind to receive a particular treatment. Secondly, random assignment permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between intervention groups reflects mere chance.8 Thirdly, random allocation, in some situations, facilitates blinding the identity of treatments to the investigators, participants, and evaluators, possibly by use of a placebo, which reduces bias after assignment of treatments.9 Of these three advantages, reducing selection bias at trial entry is usually the most important.10\nSuccessful randomisation in practice depends on two inter-related aspects: adequate generation of an unpredictable allocation sequence and concealment of that sequence until assignment occurs.4,5 A key issue is whether the sequence is known or predictable by the people involved in allocating participants to the comparison groups.11 The treatment allocation system should thus be set up so that the person enrolling participants does not know in advance which treatment the next person will get, a process termed allocation concealment.4,5 Proper allocation concealment shields knowledge of forthcoming assignments, whereas proper random sequences prevent correct anticipation of future assignments based on knowledge of past assignments.\nWho generated the random allocation sequence is important mainly for two reasons. Firstly, someone, or some group, should take responsibility for this critical trial function. Secondly, providing information on the generator might help readers to evaluate whether anyone had access to the allocation sequence during implementation. Investigators should strive for complete separation, independence, between the trial staff involved with generation of the allocation sequence and those staff who implement assignments (see explanation for item 19).\nParticipants should be assigned to comparison groups in the trial on the basis of a chance (random) process characterised by unpredictability (box 5). Successful randomisation in practice depends on two inter-related aspects: adequate generation of an unpredictable allocation sequence and concealment of that sequence until assignment occurs. A key issue is whether the sequence is known or predictable by the people involved in allocating participants to the comparison groups. The treatment allocation system should thus be set up so that the person enrolling participants does not know in advance which treatment the next person will receive, a process termed allocation concealment (item 18). Proper allocation concealment shields knowledge of forthcoming assignments, whereas proper random sequences (item 17) prevent correct anticipation of future assignments based on knowledge of past assignments (box 5).\nAuthors should provide sufficient information such that the reader can assess the methods used to generate the random allocation sequence and the likelihood of bias in group assignment. Any software used for random sequence generation should also be reported. It is important that information on the process of randomisation is included in the body of the main article and not as a separate supplementary file, where it can be missed by the reader.\nThe term “random” has a precise technical meaning. With random allocation, each participant has a known probability of receiving each intervention before one is assigned, and the assigned intervention is determined by a chance process and cannot be predicted. However, “random” is sometimes used inappropriately in the literature to describe trials in which non-random, “deterministic” allocation methods were used, such as alternation, hospital numbers, or date of birth. When investigators use such non-random methods, they should describe them precisely and should not use the term “random” or any variation of it. Even the term “quasi-random” is unacceptable for describing such trials. Trials based on non-random methods generally yield biased results124,13–18; bias presumably arises from the inability to adequately conceal these more predictable, non-random sequence generation systems.\nMany methods of sequence generation are adequate. However, readers cannot judge adequacy from such terms as “random allocation,” “randomisation,” or “random” without further elaboration. Authors should specify the method of sequence generation, such as a random-number table or a computerised random number generator. The sequence may be generated by the process of minimisation, a non-random but generally acceptable method.\nIn some trials, participants are intentionally allocated in unequal numbers to each intervention: for example, to gain more experience with a new procedure or to limit costs of the trial. In such cases, authors should report the randomisation ratio (eg, 2:1, or two treatment participants per control participant; item 9).\nIn a representative sample of PubMed indexed trials in 2000, only 21% reported an adequate approach to random sequence generation19; this increased to 34% for a similar cohort of PubMed indexed trials in 2006.20 Two more recent studies showed further small increases to about 40%,21,22 but another reported a stubbornly similar level of 32%.18 When authors report an adequate approach to random sequence generation, in over 90% of cases they report using a random number generator on a computer or a random number table.2022",

Two public contributors were members of the independent trial steering committee.”1\n“The UK Musculoskeletal Trauma Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Group co-designed this study. In particular, the group advised on the choice of outcome measures and the follow-up arrangements, which were designed to limit the number of face-to-face hospital visits needed.

Another patient member of the group was also a member of the independent Trial Steering Committee.”2\n“Office workers, workplace champions, and managers within the target organisation were involved in the study design during the grant application process and the study delivery phase. During the grant application phase, the purpose and design of the study as well as the suggested intervention strategies were presented to two large groups of council employees. As a result of these meetings, the study design included using finger prick blood testing rather than taking venous blood samples, participants receiving feedback on health measures, and incentives for attending follow-up. During the study set-up and delivery, a council employee advisory group met several times and provided advice on delivery of the interventions (feedback showed that workplace champions would not be comfortable delivering the initial education session because of the training and planning time required, so this session was delivered online instead), recruitment processes (feedback was provided on participant documents and recruitment messages and strategies within the council), installation of the height adjustable desk, and troubleshooting. Two council employees were also part of the trial steering committee, which met twice a year during the study”.3\n“In the context of the pandemic and the need to design the study in a short period, no patients were involved in setting the research questions or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.”4",

    "text": "Explanation\nPatient and public involvement (PPI) has been shown to be particularly beneficial in clinical trials.5 It can help researchers to identify and prioritise research topics and questions; identify relevant outcome measures; boost recruitment and retention; improve trial design and tools; and improve the acceptability of trials.5,6 PPI can also improve the communication and dissemination of the trial results to participants. Public involvement in other types of health research has been shown to help researchers to engage under-served populations and recruit diverse participant groups.5 Thus, transparent reporting of PPI is essential to allow readers to appraise the relevance and usefulness of findings to end users and to fully evaluate and understand a trial’s methodology and conduct. If patients and the public were not involved, authors should report this with the reasons why.\nPPI in health research entails collaborating or partnering with patients and members of the public to design, conduct, report, interpret, or disseminate research: the research is done by or with patients and the public—rather than done for, at, or about them.7,89 Importantly, this is distinct from including patients or members of the public in a trial as participants. PPI contributors can be people with current or past experience of a health condition; their families, carers, and advocates; members of communities who are target users of an intervention or service; or members of the wider public with a broader perspective. The terminology used differs internationally: for example, such activity is most commonly known as “patient and public involvement” in the UK, whereas “patient engagement” is more common in mainland Europe and North America,8,9, “community and public engagement” is commonly used in part of Africa, and “consumer involvement” is frequently used in Australia.10\nThe GRIPP (Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and Public) checklist was developed in 2011 with the aim of improving the reporting of PPI activities in health research11; followed in 2017 by GRIPP2.12 The GRIPP2 checklist includes GRIPP2-SF, which is a short form of the GRIPP2 checklist where PPI is the secondary focus of the research.12 Examples of reporting of PPI involvement could include whether and how patients were involved in the trial objectives, whether patients advised on optimising patient recruitment and retention, and whether and how patients were included in selection of the trial outcomes.\nFunding bodies are increasingly encouraging or requiring researchers to include PPI in grant applications,7,13,14 but mandating of PPI reporting by journals has remained uncommon. In 2014, The BMJ introduced a requirement for submitted manuscripts to include a PPI statement,15 and this was extended to other BMJ journals from 2018.16,17 A 2023 study of trials addressing chronic conditions found that approximately 80% of trial reports published in these journals included a PPI subsection, and around 40% of these reported that PPI activities had been conducted.18 Few other journals have followed suit in mandating reporting of PPI activities.19–21 In the absence of an explicit requirement, reporting of PPI activities remains infrequent, appearing in an estimated 0-5% of published trial reports.22–24 There is limited evidence to indicate the extent to which this reflects a lack of PPI activity versus PPI activity being conducted but not reported. In a small survey of authors of trials published in high impact factor journals, only one of 29 respondents reported PPI activities having been included but not mentioned in the published article24; while in a survey of authors of pragmatic trials, 47% reported including PPI activities during a trial but less than a quarter of these reported the activity in the corresponding publication.25",

If participants were excluded after randomisation (contrary to the intention-to-treat principle) because they were found not to meet eligibility criteria, they should be included in the flow diagram. Use of the term “protocol deviation” in published articles is not sufficient to justify exclusion of participants after randomisation. The nature of the protocol deviation and the exact reason for excluding participants after randomisation should always be reported. Similarly, if participants did not complete the treatment intervention as allocated (ie, discontinued treatment), this should be reported by trial group, with reasons.\nWhile attrition as a result of loss to follow-up is often unavoidable, it is important to report the number of participants who do not complete follow-up as planned; this should be reported by trial group along with reasons.

    "text": "Explanation\nObjectives are the questions that the trial was designed to answer. Adequate reporting of the research question is essential to allow readers to appraise and interpret the trial results. The PICO framework, which requires defining the patient population (P); the experimental intervention (I); the comparator intervention or condition (C); and the outcome or outcomes (O) of interest, has been proposed to help define the research question. PICO is sometimes styled as PICOTS, to include T (the timeframe) and/or S (the setting).2\nTreatment decisions require an evaluation of the balance between benefit and harm; however, information about harms is frequently omitted or incompletely reported in published reports of trial results.3–6 Trials whose primary objective is to evaluate benefits of an intervention may not be powered to detect harms, but authors should still report whether they considered harms outcomes when planning the trial.7\nAuthors should clarify whether the aim is to establish superiority of the experimental intervention, or non-inferiority or equivalence, as compared with the comparator intervention.8 Authors should also report whether the trial is intended to provide preliminary data (a pilot or feasibility trial),9 explore pharmacokinetic properties, or generate confirmatory results.\nFor multi-arm trials, authors should clarify which treatment group comparisons are of interest (eg, A v B; A v C). If authors planned to readjust the objective during the trial (eg, in some platform trials or basket trials10), this should be reported. Finally, trials can be designed to study the effect of the experimental intervention under different conditions, often described on a spectrum from ideal conditions (explanatory trial) to standard clinical care conditions (pragmatic trial).11\nThe objectives should be phrased using neutral wording (eg, “to compare the effect of treatment A versus treatment B on outcome X for persons with condition Y”) rather than in terms of a particular direction of effect.12 The trial objectives should align with what was specified in the trial registry and protocol; any changes to the trial objectives after it commenced should be reported with reasons (item 10).\nRecently, some trials have been designed using the estimands framework to define the research question and trial objectives. While the terminology surrounding estimands may be new to some investigators, it is expected that the use of this framework will become more widespread. Box 1 provides more information about the estimands framework and how it is being used.\n\nEstimands\nConcerns have been raised that the precise research questions that randomised trials set out to answer are often unclear.13 In particular, there is often ambiguity around how events occurring after randomisation (termed intercurrent events) are handled. Specifying the research question using an estimands framework is increasingly used to improve clarity. Despite calls for estimands to be included in the CONSORT 2025 statement,13,14 their inclusion did not reach consensus. However, we provide a brief overview of estimands and introduce terminology, so they can be applied and reported if used. A more detailed primer on the estimand framework which provides practical guidance on estimands in studies of healthcare interventions can be found elsewhere.14\nICH E9(R1) defines an estimand as “a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question posed by a given clinical trial objective.”15 The estimands framework provides a structured description of the objectives in an attempt to bring clarity in specifying the research question, which can be used to guide the study design, data collection, and statistical analysis methods. In brief, an estimand comprises five key attributes: population, treatment groups, endpoint, summary measure, and handling of intercurrent events (see Table 1). A separate estimand should be defined for each study outcome, and for some outcomes, more than one estimand may be defined.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Five key attributes of the estimand framework14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nPatients for whom researchers want to estimate the treatment effect\n\n\nTreatment groups\nDifferent intervention strategies being compared in the treatment effect definition\n\n\nEndpoint\nOutcome for each participant that is used in the treatment effect definition\n\n\nSummary measure\nMethod used to summarise and compare the endpoint between treatment conditions (eg, risk ratio, odds ratio)\n\n\nHandling of intercurrent events\nStrategies used to handle each intercurrent event (see below) in the treatment effect definition; different strategies could be used for different types of intercurrent events\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercurrent events are post-baseline events (or post-randomisation events in randomised trials) that affect the interpretation or existence of outcome data. These events frequently affect receipt of treatment (eg, treatment switching or treatment discontinuation) or preclude existence of the outcome (eg, death, if it is not defined as part of the outcome).\nThe ICH E9(R1) outlines five strategies for handling intercurrent events, which are at the core of the estimand framework (see Table 2).\n\n\n\nTable 2: Strategies for handling intercurrent events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTreatment policy\nThe occurrence of the intercurrent event is considered irrelevant in defining the treatment effect of interest: the value for the outcome of interest is used regardless of whether the intercurrent event occurs\n\n\nHypothetical\nThe treatment effect in a scenario where the intercurrent event did not occur is of interest\n\n\nComposite\nThe intercurrent event is incorporated into the outcome definition\n\n\nWhile on treatment\nThe outcome before the occurrence of the intercurrent event is of interest\n\n\nPrincipal stratum\nThe outcome in a subpopulation of patients who would not (or would) experience the intercurrent event is of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the terminology surrounding estimands may be new to some investigators, it is expected that defining research questions using the estimands framework will become more widespread. A number of existing reporting guidelines have recently included estimands with the reporting recommendations.16–18 If the estimands framework has been used to design the trial or the data collection or to inform the statistical analysis (by guiding choice of appropriate methods), then this should be made clear in the manuscript and the methods and results should be reported within the framework.",

Although the latter factor may be perceived as a limitation, published data indicate no benefit (either short-term or long-term) with respect to death and myocardial infarction in patients with stable coronary artery disease who receive drug-eluting stents, as compared with those who receive bare-metal stents.”1\n“Our study had several limitations. The early changes to the protocol to accommodate patients with a shorter injury history (but still not acute) to improve recruitment altered the characteristics of the study population. Overall, patients had less long-standing injury than was originally planned. Moreover, the study addressed a deliberately specific population of patients who continued to have ACL injury-related symptoms of instability and had not undergone any previous formal treatment. Another potential limitation is the proportion of patients who did not undergo surgical reconstruction, despite allocation to that group. The true benefit of surgical reconstruction could be somewhat greater than the ITT analysis suggests. The 18-month follow-up period ideally could have been longer but was constrained by various factors including funding. Notwithstanding, most patients had established their level of instability at this timepoint since being included in the trial. The trial design and analysis accounted for delayed surgery in both groups.”2",

    "text": "Explanation\nAn essential part of a good discussion section is summarising the limitations of the trial. Limitations are frequently omitted from research reports3; identification and discussion of the weaknesses of a study have particular importance.\nSome journals have attempted to remedy this problem by encouraging more structure to authors’ discussion of their results.4,5 For example, The BMJ recommends that authors structure the discussion section by presenting (1) a statement of the principal findings; (2) the strengths and weaknesses of the study; (3) the strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies, discussing important differences in results; (4) the meaning of the study, its possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policymakers; and (5) any unanswered questions and future research.6 We recommend that authors follow these sensible suggestions, perhaps also using suitable subheadings in the discussion section.\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including measurement of a primary outcome (item 14) or diagnosis (item 12a). Perhaps the scale used was validated on an adult population but used in a paediatric one, or the assessor was not trained in how to administer the instrument.\nThe difference between statistical significance and clinical importance should always be borne in mind. Authors should particularly avoid the common error of interpreting a non-significant result as indicating equivalence of interventions. The CI (item 26) provides valuable insight into whether the trial result is compatible with a clinically important effect, regardless of the P value.7\nAuthors should exercise special care when evaluating the results of trials with multiple comparisons. Such multiplicity arises from several interventions, outcome measures, time points, subgroup analyses, and other factors. In such circumstances, some statistically significant findings are likely to result from chance alone.\nAuthors should also consider the extent to which the results of a study can be generalised to other circumstances; also known as external validity. For example, can the results be generalised to an individual participant or groups that differ from those enrolled in the trial with regard to age, sex, severity of disease, and comorbid conditions? Are the results applicable to other drugs within a class of similar drugs, to a different dose, timing, and route of administration? Can similar results be expected in different healthcare settings? What about the effect on related outcomes that were not assessed in the trial, and the importance of length of follow-up and duration of treatment, especially with respect to harms?8 Internal validity, the extent to which the design and conduct of the trial eliminates the possibility of bias, is a prerequisite for external validity: the results of a flawed trial are invalid and the question of its external validity becomes irrelevant. External validity is a matter of judgement and depends on the characteristics of the participants included in the trial, the trial setting, the treatment regimens tested, and the outcomes assessed.",

    "text": "Explanation\nThis new item has been added to the CONSORT 2025 checklist to address the poor reporting of the intervention and comparator in randomised trials.3–8 For example, in a review of 102 randomised trials evaluating bariatric surgery, only 14% reported the intervention as implemented.9 A review of 192 randomised trials assessing pharmacological treatments in six major chronic diseases published in journals with high impact factors showed that adherence to medication was reported in only one third of the publications.10 A review of 100 randomised trial reports published in general medical journals with high impact factors highlighted that only 11% of the trials assessing long term interventions and 38% of those assessing short term interventions adequately reported treatment initiation and completeness of treatment.11 A review of 111 randomised trials reports showed that only 46% reported adherence results.12 A review of 94 placebo/sham controlled randomised trials published in high impact journals showed that only 54% reported actual adherence or fidelity.8\nThere is frequently a gap between the intervention/comparator as planned and described in the trial protocol and how the intervention/comparator were actually administered. This gap could be related to poor fidelity, which can be driven by the extent to which the intervention/comparator are implemented as planned in the protocol by practitioners, and/or poor adherence to treatment, defined as the extent to which participants comply with the care providers’ recommendations (eg, taking a drug, placebo, behavioural change, doing exercises).11,13 This gap could also be related to the expected diversity in the implementation of the intervention/comparator in clinical practice particularly for complex interventions.\nThe gap between the intervention/comparator as planned and as delivered also depends on how the trial was planned. In explanatory trials, the aim is to estimate treatment effect under ideal circumstances. The intervention/comparator are usually highly standardised with close monitoring of fidelity and adherence to interventions and strategies to increase them. Intensive efforts to maximise fidelity and adherence in early phase trials or explanatory trials may lead to unrealistic, inflated estimates of treatment benefit that cannot be reproduced under real life circumstances.14,15 Reporting the results of this monitoring is essential to allow readers to interpret the study results.\nIn contrast, pragmatic trials aim to determine treatment effect in clinical conditions. The intervention and comparator are usually highly flexible, and measurement of fidelity and adherence is unobstructive with no strategies to maintain or improve them.\nReporting how the intervention/comparator were actually administered is nevertheless crucial to allow readers to accurately interpret the trial results. For example, in a large international randomised trial comparing endarterectomy to medical management for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, there were important differences in the delay in receiving the surgical procedure which impacted the outcomes.16\nAuthors should provide details on who actually delivered the intervention/comparator (number and expertise), how the intervention/comparator were delivered, what was actually administered, participants’ adherence to treatment, and the caregiver’s fidelity to the intervention/comparator protocol where appropriate. Reporting fidelity and adherence can be complex and vary according to the type of intervention or comparator (eg, one-off, short term repeated, long term repeated). Various deviations to the protocol can occur. Participants might initiate the intervention/comparator but then discontinue the intervention/comparator permanently and completely after a specific period of time, discontinue temporarily, reduce the dose, or modify the schedule.\nMore detailed information is available in TIDieR17 and the CONSORT extension for non-pharmacological treatments18 (item 13).",

However, despite these reductions in malaria, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (composite primary endpoint) was significantly lower in the sulfadoxine– pyrimethamine group than in both dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine groups . . .\n“In a previous meta-analysis a modest, but nonsignificant, reduction of 17% in the number of adverse pregnancy outcomes favouring dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine versus sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was reported . . . These findings led WHO [World Health Organization] to recommend larger definitive studies to determine whether IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine improves adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with sulfadoxine– pyrimethamine in areas with high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. Our results are consistent with those from a third trial in eastern Uganda, which showed that monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine did not decrease the number of adverse pregnancy outcomes among livebirths or reduce fetal loss compared with monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine . . . All of these trials, including ours, show that dihydroartemisinin– piperaquine is the superior antimalarial, resulting in 40–90% fewer malaria infections during pregnancy.”1",

    "text": "Explanation\nA good discussion section of a completed randomised trial should start with a brief summary of the trial results, balancing both benefits and harms of the intervention. The discussion sections of scientific reports are often filled with rhetoric supporting the authors’ findings2 and provide little measured argument of the pros and cons of the study and its results. Indeed, some discussion sections can be overly optimistic when discussing the trial findings (interpretation bias; spin).3–6 Authors need to guard against such behaviours, as they diminish the rigour of the scientific effort and may result in a loss of trust by readers.\nReaders will also want to know how the trial results relate to those of other randomised trials. This can best be achieved by including a published systematic review in the results or discussion section of the report.7,8 This might be an easy ask for some authors as a systematic review might have been part of the rationale for conducting the trial. However, for others, such synthesis may be impractical, and quoting and discussing any existing systematic reviews of similar trials may be more appropriate. One recent estimate suggests that nearly 80 systematic reviews are published daily.9 Discussing trial findings in the context of results from any systematic reviews will help readers assess whether the results of the randomised trial are similar to those of other trials in the same topic area and whether participants are similar across studies. Reports of randomised trials have often not dealt adequately with these points.7 Several methods to address the issue of setting new trial findings within the context of previous research have been proposed.8 Where conducting a new updated systematic review is not practical, adding the new trial result to the previous systematic review is a much simpler alternative.\nWe recommend that at a minimum, the discussion should be as systematic and objective as possible and be based on a comprehensive search, rather than being limited to studies that support the results of the current trial.10,11",

    "text": "Explanation\nReaders need information about the harms as well as the benefits of interventions to make rational and balanced decisions. Randomised trials offer an excellent opportunity for providing harms data, although they cannot detect differences in uncommon or rare harms between treatment groups. The existence and nature of adverse effects can have a major impact on whether a particular intervention will be deemed acceptable and useful. Not all reported adverse events observed during a trial are necessarily a consequence of the intervention; some may be a consequence of the condition being treated. Nevertheless, they all need to be reported.\nMany reports of randomised trials provide inadequate information on harms. A comparison between harm data submitted to the trials database of the National Cancer Institute, which sponsored the trials, and the information reported in journal articles found that low grade adverse events were under-reported in journal articles. High grade events (Common Toxicity Criteria grades 3 to 5) were reported inconsistently in the articles and the information regarding attribution to investigational drugs was incomplete.2 Moreover, a review of trials published in six general medical journals in 2006 to 2007 found that while 89% of 133 reports mentioned adverse events, no information on severe adverse events and withdrawal of patients owing to an adverse event was given in 27% and 48% of articles, respectively.3 In a later review of 196 randomised trials of invasive pain treatments published in six major journals, 76% provided the denominators for analyses on harms and 85% reported the absolute risk per arm and per adverse event type, grade, and seriousness, and presented appropriate metrics.4\nFor non-systematically assessed harms, reporting can be more complex as the information is not standardised. A common approach is to code the event declared by participants. Authors should report the coding system used, whether coding was prespecified in the protocol, in the statistical analysis plan, or post hoc, and whether coding was performed by researchers blinded to the treatment allocated. In addition, there is a risk of under-reporting and selective non-reporting of harms particularly for non-systematically assessed harms. A reanalysis of individual participant data from six randomised trials of gabapentin found evidence of important harms that were not disclosed in the published reports but identified after data sharing and reanalysis.5 Sharing of de-identified individual participant data may be needed to be able to adequately synthesise this information, for example for inclusion in a systematic review.6,78\nAuthors should report for each group, the number of participants at risk, the number of deaths, the number of participants withdrawn due to harms, the number of participants with at least one harm event, and the number of events, if appropriate. Where appropriate, the estimated effect size with its precision (such as 95% CIs) should be reported including both absolute and relative effects for binary outcomes. It is important to separate the reporting of systematically and non-systematically assessed harms. Systematically assessed harms should be reported even if zero events were identified. It should also be clear whether the authors are reporting the number of participants with at least one harm event or the number of events per unit of time at risk and whether recurrent events were included. The number of participants withdrawn because of harms should also be reported for each group. Finally, results should be reported for all harms. We strongly discourage the use of thresholds or criteria to select which harms should be reported. All harms could be detailed in supplementary materials.\nWe recommend reporting the results in a table with the results for each trial arm.9 More detailed information can be found in the CONSORT statement extension for harms, which was updated in 2022.10",

    "text": "Explanation\nFor all types of trials, it is important to define the eligibility criteria for clinical sites, and to consider the characteristics of the treatment providers who will provide both the experimental and comparator interventions.2,3 Evidence suggests that patient outcomes can be associated with hospital and care provider volume.3 A systematic review of 135 trials found that 71% observed a positive association between hospital volume and outcomes, and 70% observed an association between care provider volume and outcomes.4 Different levels of expertise of care providers in each intervention group can bias treatment effect estimates.5 Furthermore, an intervention might be found to be safe and effective in a trial performed in high volume sites by high volume care providers but could have different results in low volume sites. For example, in an analysis of Medicare National Claim files of 167 208 patients who had undergone coronary stent surgery, patients treated by high volume physicians and at high volume sites experienced better outcomes than those treated by low volume physicians at low volume sites.6 Similar studies show that in most non-pharmacological trials, care provider expertise and site volume will influence treatment effects.7–9\nEligibility criteria for care providers and sites are often poorly reported. A systematic review of randomised trials in surgery found that the setting and the site volume of activity were reported in only 7% and 3% of articles, respectively. Eligibility criteria were reported for care providers in 41% of the articles, and the number of care providers performing the intervention was reported in 32%.10 A careful description of care providers involved in the trial, as well as details of the sites in which participants were treated, helps readers appraise the risk of bias and the applicability of the results.2,3 Eligibility criteria for sites typically relate to site volume for the procedure under investigation or similar procedures. Eligibility criteria for care providers might include professional qualifications, years in practice, number of interventions performed, skill as assessed by level of complication when performing the intervention, and specific training before trial initiation. Exclusion criteria should be justified because they will influence the applicability of the trial results.3",

    "text": "Explanation\nData and code sharing can take the transparency of trial reporting to a different, more desirable level. Sharing individual de-identified participant data would be helpful in many ways: verifying results and increasing trust; using data more extensively for secondary analyses; and using data for individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD MA). Data sharing is also associated with increased citations3 (ie, broader dissemination). Some trial groups have worked collaboratively to conduct IPD MA.4 However, for most randomised trials, data sharing does not happen.5–9 During the covid-19 pandemic, there were many examples of authors’ intentions to share data that then did not transpire (ie, they did not share their data).8,10 There is increasing concern that some trials are fraudulent or considered to be so-called zombie trials, which becomes evident only on inspection of the raw data.11,12 However, even if zombie trials are not as prevalent as feared, genuine trials can have such an important role and high value that it is important to maximise their utility by making them more open. Detailed documentation of sharing plans may help in this direction.13\nAll data sharing should abide by the principle of being as open as possible and as closed as necessary throughout a randomised trial’s life cycle (from SPIRIT to CONSORT). It is important to ensure that all the appropriate permissions are included on the patient consent forms. Trials cannot share data that are not fully anonymised without the appropriate patient consent, and full anonymisation can be difficult. Care must be taken to share participant data appropriately to maintain confidentiality. Suitable mechanisms must be in place to appropriately de-identify participant data, and data should only be shared in a safe and secure manner that fits with the consent obtained from participants.\nData sharing typically involves sharing: the underlying data generated from the trial’s conduct; a data dictionary (ie, structure, content, and meaning of each data variable); and other relevant material(s) used as part of the trial’s analysis such as the trial protocol, data management plan, statistical analysis plan, and code used to analyse the data. A trial’s data can be shared in a variety of ways, such as via an institutional repository (eg, belonging to the university associated with the trial’s coordinating centre) and/or a public-facing repository, or by having a bespoke process to provide data. Often, a data use agreement is necessary, which will, at a minimum: prohibit attempts to reidentify or contact trial participants; address any requirements regarding planned outputs of the proposed research (eg, publication and acknowledgment requirements); and prohibit non-approved uses or further distribution of the data.14\nIn a growing number of jurisdictions, funders such as the National Institute for Health (NIH),15 in the US and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) in the UK, alongside other funders such as the Gate’s Foundation, now require researchers to share their data and make the results publicly available for anyone to read. Similarly, some journals are also requiring authors to include a data sharing statement as part of the article submission process (eg, Annals of Internal Medicine, The BMJ, JAMA Network journals, PLoS Medicine).\nThe process of signalling how data sharing will be achieved is often contained in a data management plan but may also be found in the trial protocol or statistical analysis plan. More complete details regarding developing a data management plan are beyond the scope of this paper. Such details can be found elsewhere.16 Authors should provide some description of where these details can be found (eg, name of repository and URL to data, code, and materials). Sharing may also entail embargo periods, and if so, the choice of an embargo should be justified and its length should be stated.17 If data (or some parts thereof) cannot be shared, the reasons for this should be reported and should be sensible and following ethical principles.\nFor more complex trials (eg, types of talking therapies, physiotherapy), additional materials to share might include a handbook and/or video to detail the intervention.14 Often these can be shared much more freely than the data, as there are fewer issues with confidentiality.",

Our original sample size used a POEM score for minimal clinically important difference of 3, which was based on research carried out in secondary care among people with moderate or severe eczema. Fresh evidence, however, suggested that a change in POEM score of 2.1 to 2.9 represents a change likely to be beyond measurement error.

    "text": "Explanation\nA protocol for a randomised trial serves as the foundation for planning, conduct, reporting, and appraisal, specifying in detail how the trial will be conducted. There may be deviations from the original protocol, as it is impossible to predict every possible change in circumstances during the course of a trial. Some trials will therefore have important changes to the methods after trial commencement. There are many reasons for deviations from the initial study protocol; for example, changes could be due to external information becoming available from other studies, or internal financial difficulties, or lower than anticipated recruitment rates. In some trials, an independent data monitoring committee will have as part of its remit the possibility of recommending protocol changes based on seeing unblinded data. Authors should report the nature and timing of protocol changes because changes made at different times (eg, before or after breaking the blinding) might be associated with different risks of bias.\nAuthors should report all major changes to the trial after it commenced indicating the reason for the changes and when the changes occurred.3 Such changes might affect the trial methods, such as the randomisation ratio, eligibility criteria, interventions, outcomes, method of analysis or duration of follow-up; or might affect the trial conduct, such as dropping a trial site with poor data quality.4\nSome trials are set up with a formal adaptive design, which allows pre-planned changes to an ongoing trial without compromising the validity of conclusions.5 It is therefore essential to distinguish pre-planned changes from unplanned changes that may also occur. Such adaptive trial design modifications are usually to the sample size and number of treatment groups, and can lead to decisions being made more quickly and with more efficient use of resources than would be possible with traditional, non-adaptive parallel group trials. Specific guidance has been developed for reporting trials with a formal adaptive design; authors could consult this for more detailed information.5\nMost trials record multiple outcomes, with the risk that results will be reported for only a selected subset. Prespecification and reporting of completely defined primary and secondary outcomes for both benefits and harms (item 14) should remove such a risk. In some trials, however, circumstances require a change in the way an outcome is assessed, the designation of outcomes as primary or secondary or even, as in the example above, a switch to a different outcome. For example, there may be external evidence from other trials or systematic reviews suggesting the time point for the primary outcome might not be appropriate; or recruitment or the overall event rate in the trial may be lower than expected.1 Changing an endpoint based on unblinded data are much more problematic, although may be specified in the context of an adaptive trial design.5\nWhether the modifications are explicitly part of the trial design or in response to changing circumstances, it is essential that they are fully reported and the reason for the change explained to help the reader interpret the results. Such information is not always reported. A comparison of protocols and publications of 102 randomised trials found that 62% of trial reports had at least one primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted compared with the protocol.6 Primary outcomes also differed between protocols and publications for 40% of a cohort of 48 trials funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.7 None of these subsequent 150 trial reports mentioned, let alone explained, changes from the protocol. Similar results from other studies have been reported in a systematic review of empirical studies, comparing trial registers or protocols to published trial reports.8",

Specific procedures to maintain blinding can be implemented (eg, centralised assessment of side effects, centralised adapted dosage, or provision of sham results of complementary investigations).\nEven if blinding of participants and healthcare providers is not possible, blinding data collectors and outcome assessors could still be implemented to limit ascertainment bias. This could be achieved, for example, through centralised assessment of complementary investigation (eg, anonymised radiography), physician mediated data (eg, video, photography, audiotape), and clinical events (eg, adjudication of clinical events from extract of the case report form).\nDetails of how blinding was achieved are important because slight, but discernible, differences between interventions can lead to large problems in bias. Notably, inadequate matching related to discernible differences in colour and taste seem particularly problematic.6 It is important that authors report any known compromises in blinding. For example, authors should report if it was necessary to unblind any participants at any point during the conduct of the trial. Moreover, authors should report the risk of unblinding but, unfortunately, such reporting is rare. In a random sample of 300 publications describing blinded randomised clinical trials indexed in PubMed, only 8% reported on risk of unblinding.7 It is also important to report any procedures, pretrial or concurrent, that are intended to reduce or evaluate risk of compromised blinding.6–8 Indeed, some pretrial assessments of unblinding may be helpful in reducing the risk of unblinding in the eventual randomised trial. Thus, authors of randomised trial articles should report procedures to avoid, document, and address cases of overt unblinding.6,7\nWhere appropriate, authors should also describe any procedures used for emergency unblinding (ie, disclosing the assigned intervention of a trial participant for specific reasons such as harms). They should indicate whether they used fixed code to indicate group assignment (eg, A=group 1; B=group 2) or a unique code for each participant. Use of a fixed code will increase the risk of unblinding because unblinding a participant could result in unblinding several or all trial participants.9–11\nSome people have advocated testing for blinding by asking participants or healthcare providers at the end of a trial whether they think the participant received the experimental or control intervention.12 Because participants and healthcare providers will frequently know whether the participant has experienced the primary outcome, this makes it difficult to determine whether their responses reflect failure of blinding or accurate assumptions about the efficacy of the intervention.13 Thus, given the uncertainty this type of information provides, the usefulness of tests of blinding has been questioned.6,7,14 Testing for blinding was not an included item in CONSORT 2010, and still is not in CONSORT 2025. Nevertheless, if investigators decide to conduct tests of blinding, we encourage them to completely report their findings with appropriate limitations.8",

Evidence from small, short-term trials suggests that physiotherapist-prescribed exercise is promising. However, a Cochrane review highlighted the insufficient evidence about the treatment's long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Despite widespread provision, uncertainty exists about which types of exercise and levels of physiotherapy supervision are associated with the best outcomes. This evidence is limited by problems in study design and lack of comparator groups. Progressive resistance training to improve muscular strength, whether supervised or home based, has been identified as a core component of exercise for patients with rotator cuff disorders. Subacromial corticosteroid injections are commonly used to reduce local tissue inflammation and pain. Compared with placebo, corticosteroid injections have short-term benefit in the shoulder, although the longer-term benefits and harms are not known. Corticosteroid injections are being used increasingly in clinical practice alongside physiotherapy for the management of people with rotator cuff disorders; hence justification for investigating corticosteroid injection in the GRASP (Getting it Right: Addressing Shoulder Pain) trial alongside physiotherapist-prescribed exercise.”1",

The rationale may be explanatory (eg, to assess the possible influence of a drug on renal function under tightly regulated conditions) or pragmatic (eg, to guide practice by comparing the benefits and harms of two treatments in a clinical setting). Authors should report any evidence of the benefits and harms of active interventions included in a trial and should suggest a plausible explanation for how the interventions might work, if this is not obvious. Understanding the rationale or theory underpinning an intervention helps readers to understand which aspects or components are likely to be essential to its efficacy.2 In addition, authors should justify the choice of comparator(s).3,4 The choice of the comparator (active or placebo) will influence effect estimates. It could raise ethical concerns if patients could be allocated to a placebo or to a suboptimal treatment while an active treatment has been proven effective. Authors should justify the need for the trial they conducted and show that there was equipoise about the best treatment for the condition in the population being studied.\nThe Declaration of Helsinki states that biomedical research involving people should be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature.5 It is unethical to expose humans unnecessarily to the risks of research. Some clinical trials have been shown to have been unnecessary because the question they addressed had been, or could have been, answered by a systematic review of the existing literature.6–8 Thus, the need for a new trial should be justified in the introduction. Ideally, this justification should include a reference to one or more systematic reviews of previous trials. In the absence of a published systematic review, authors should report and summarise the results of previous relevant trials or note their absence.9 The percentage of published trial reports that cite a systematic review of pre-existing evidence where one is available has increased over time, but over a quarter still fail to do so.10",

    "text": "Explanation\nItem 17 discussed generation of an unpredictable sequence of assignments. Of considerable importance is how this sequence is applied when participants are enrolled into the trial. A generated allocation sequence should be implemented by using allocation concealment,7 a critical mechanism that prevents foreknowledge of treatment assignment and thus shields those who enrol participants from being influenced by this knowledge. The decision to accept or reject a participant should be made, and informed consent should be obtained from the participant, in ignorance of the next assignment in the sequence.8 In summary, adequate allocation concealment safeguards knowledge of forthcoming assignments, whereas proper random sequences (item 17) prevent correct anticipation of future assignments based on knowledge of past assignments.\nAllocation concealment should not be confused with blinding (item 20). Allocation concealment seeks to prevent selection bias, protects the assignment sequence before and until allocation, and can always be successfully implemented.9 In contrast, blinding seeks to prevent ascertainment bias, protects the sequence after allocation, and cannot always be implemented.7 Without adequate allocation concealment, however, even random, unpredictable assignment sequences can be subverted.9,10\nCentralised or third party assignment is especially desirable. Many good allocation concealment mechanisms incorporate external involvement. Use of a pharmacy or central computer or telephone randomisation system are common techniques. Automated assignment systems are likely to become more common.11 When external involvement is not feasible, an excellent method of allocation concealment is the use of numbered containers. The interventions (often medicines) are sealed in sequentially numbered identical containers according to the allocation sequence.12 Enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes can be a good allocation concealment mechanism if it is developed and monitored diligently.13,14 This method can be corrupted, however, particularly if it is poorly executed. Investigators should ensure that the envelopes are opaque when held to the light, and are opened sequentially and only after the participant’s name and other details are written on the appropriate sequentially numbered sealed envelope.13–15\nA number of methodological studies provide empirical evidence to support these precautions.9,16–1920–22 Trials in which the allocation sequence had been inadequately or unclearly concealed yielded larger estimates of treatment effects than did trials in which authors reported adequate allocation concealment. These findings provide strong empirical evidence that inadequate allocation concealment contributes to bias in estimating treatment effects.\nDespite the importance of the mechanism of allocation concealment, published reports frequently omit such details. Among older studies, the mechanism used to allocate interventions was omitted in reports of 89% of trials on rheumatoid arthritis,23 48% of trials in obstetrics and gynaecology journals,7 and 44% of trials in general medical journals.24 In a more broadly representative sample of all PubMed indexed randomised trials, only 18% reported any allocation concealment mechanism and some of those reported mechanisms were inadequate.25 At the same time, some trials where there is no reporting of allocation concealment may have been properly concealed, as demonstrated by inspection of their protocols.26\nNewer studies further illuminate poor reporting of allocation concealment. Unclear reporting (ie, the authors did not provide sufficient information in the paper to allow judgment to be made on the adequacy of method of allocation concealment) was found in 78%27 and 85%19 of trials. Moreover, those two studies determined that only 27%27 and 14%19 used an adequate allocation concealment mechanism, while another found a similar level of 12%.28 A review of trials in journals of traditional Chinese medicine found that only 7% used adequate allocation concealment.29\nFortunately, reporting and conduct may be improving in recent years, for example, after the CONSORT 2010 guidelines were published.30 Another study found that reporting on allocation concealment and sequence generation was much better in journals that endorsed the CONSORT 2010 guidelines than in non-endorsing journals.14 Moreover, that study found that 57% of trials in the sample had used an adequate allocation concealment mechanism.14 However, other empirical studies show only modest improvements, for example, an evaluation of over 176 000 trials31 found that allocation concealment reporting increased from 5.1% in 1966-90 to 19.3% in 2010-18. While any improvement is encouraging, more efforts to improve conduct and reporting remain necessary.",

    "text": "Explanation\nTherapeutic interventions are often the focus of case reports or they may provide key diagnostic information. In either case, we recommend reporting them in enough detail to facilitate replication.

After this, he was healthy and free of thrombosis for almost 20 years. Between 1980 and 1987, he had multiple episodes of deep venous thrombosis, at least once a year. The thrombotic events were treated with vitamin K antagonists for periods of up to 3 months. The presence of a thrombus was verified with phlebography on at least two occasions. The proband has developed a postthrombotic syndrome in his legs but has no other disorders. Several members of the proband’s family have similar histories of multiple episodes of deep venous thrombosis (Fig. 1). His older brother by 10 years (III-2) has had deep venous thrombosis (in the legs) on several occasions, most of them occurring between the ages of 45 and 50 years. Also, his uncle (11-7) and aunt (II-5) have both had multiple episodes of thrombosis.\nA younger relative (IV-2) had clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis during her third pregnancy, but phlebography failed technically. The proband’s father, who had no history of thrombosis, is deceased. Nineteen of the family members (all living members of generations II–IV) were available for testing.

We suggest reporting other clinical management received by the patient, along with its potential impact on outcomes.

Not only was MR calmer about her previously overwhelming workload but her workload actually decreased because of increases in her efficiency and focus. For example, her e-mail inbox, a source of perpetual stress, came under control… Using MBSR focusing techniques, she turned email into tasks that were immediately accomplished and the email inbox was successfully reduced to very few items and is now emptied several times a day.\nClinically important objective measures of disease risk also improved during her mindfulness meditation experience. MR measured and recorded her blood pressure using an automated blood pressure monitor (Omron model HEM-609, Lake Forest, IL) immediately before and after her meditation sessions. In the first 8 weeks of mindfulness training, baseline blood pressure was typically elevated and classifiable as stage I hypertension. Following 45 minutes of meditation, blood pressure was reduced into the prehypertensive range and into the normal range after 10 weeks of practice. The maximal mean reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred after approximately 4 weeks (−18.5 mm Hg systolic and −25.8 mm Hg diastolic). By week 7, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure had come within the prehypertensive range and continued to decline to optimal levels (Fig. 1). At the end of the 8-week program and an additional 3 weeks of continued self-directed practice and data recording, premeditation mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced. When all daily blood pressure observations were combined, the mean reductions were highly significant: P &lt; .0001 for systolic and P &lt; .0004 for diastolic blood pressure reductions over the 11-week period (Fig. 2). Notably, as blood pressure came within the normal range, the difference before and after meditation also decreased, suggesting MR was maintaining a lower sympathetic tone.\nThe additional symptoms and behaviors she tracked, such as migraines and exercise, also were reviewed. Migraine frequency was decreased, and through MRs mindful attention to her inner experience, it was determined that migraines were now occurring only in conjunction with the phase of her menstrual cycle. Knowledge of this enabled her to plan accordingly and use her migraine abortive medications appropriately. Body weight, which has been a long-term struggle, has not changed in the 11 weeks of mindfulness meditation. MR has taken the ‘attitudes and commitment’ portion of her 8-week MBSR training very seriously.”\n\nFrom Self-directed mindfulness training and improvement in blood pressure, migraine frequency, and quality of life4.\n\n\n10b—Important follow-up test results (positive and negative)\n\n“Outcome and follow-up [Case 1]\nThe child was extubated on day 3, but the EVD was retained and kept at 10 cm H2O. It was removed after challenge on day 9. A repeat MRI showed markedly decreased cerebellar edema. The child regained a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15 and was discharged on the 11th day of admission, with no neurological deficits. He remained asymptomatic at 2-year follow-up, at which time an MRI was also found to be normal.”\n“Outcome and follow-up [Case 2]\nhe infant’s condition gradually improved, and he started tolerating breast feed. The EVD was removed after 10 days, and a repeat MRI with and without contrast, and MR venogram, showed no venous involvement and resolution of all pathological findings, including the cerebellar swelling, tonsillar herniation, and hydrocephalus. The patient was discharged on oral dexamethasone tapered over several weeks. At 1-year follow-up, the patient showed no neurological deficits and displayed normal growth and development.”\n\nFrom Acute cerebellitis successful managed with temporary cerebrospinal fluid diversion using a long tunnel external ventricular drain [EVD]: a long-term radiological follow-up of two cases5.\n\n\n10c—Intervention adherence and tolerability (and how this was assessed)\n\n“Our patients had a few important predisposing factors for parasomnia including increased work-related stress, depression, and severe sleep apnea with high arousal index. If a patient with parasomnia has any other concomitant primary sleep disorder, the treatment is initially directed toward that aspect which often resolves the parasomnia. Our first patient had severe sleep apnea that was treated adequately, but he continued to have sleepwalking and SRED despite good compliance with treatment probably because his SWS had increased after using BiPAP. Our second patient was not able to be compliant with the CPAP initially until she stopped taking quetiapine.”\n\nFrom Quetiapine-induced sleep-related eating disorder like behavior: a case series6.\n\n\n10d—Adverse and unanticipated events\n\n“A 56-year-old man weighing 77 kg was admitted with an acute anterior myocardial infarct having had a previous myocardial infarct 2 years before. He had pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure which partly responded to treatment with frusemide and diamorphine, and he had occasional ventricular extra systoles which were controlled with small doses of lignocaine. On admission, he was in mild renal failure, and over the next 36 hours, this deteriorated to the point where his plasma urea was 125 mg% and creatinine 2.03 mg%. At that time, he was given a total of 1 mg of digoxin orally (13 μg/kg) in three divided doses and shortly after the third developed the various arrhythmias which are shown in Fig. 2; just before a further dose of 0.25 mg intramuscularly; however, he had reverted to sinus rhythm and following that dose he once more developed various arrhythmias. Treatment at different times with intravenous procainamide and intravenous and oral practolol did not affect his arrhythmias, and he had already reverted to sinus rhythm when only one dose of diphenylhydantoin (50 mg) had been given orally. Other drugs which he received were heparin, warfarin, ampicillin, potassium chloride, and diazepam. His plasma digoxin levels following the fourth dose of digoxin are shown in Fig. 2. Only when the plasma digoxin level fell below 1.7 ng/mL was he free from arrhythmias. His T½β was 37.9 h and his Vd 264 L (32.4 L/kg). At a later date, when his renal function had improved slightly (urea 47 mg%, creatinine 1.37 mg%, creatinine clearance 41 ml/min), his steady-state plasma level on a reintroduced daily maintenance dose of 0.125 mg orally was 0.5 ng/mL indicating a Vd of 349 L (4.5 L/kg).”\n\nFrom Altered distribution of digoxin in renal failure—a cause of digoxin toxicity?7",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nMost case reports describe patients whose presentation is either a rare manifestation of an established disease or the first clue to a previously unknown disease. In either case, an accurate diagnosis is the essential element of a case report, and the author must provide a complete description of the diagnostic process. Whether a patient whose presentation is a rare manifestation of an established disease or the first clue to a previously unknown disease, the diagnostic assessments are essential. We recommend reporting relevant deidentified results of diagnostic evaluations with the dates they were performed. These could include laboratory results, radiographic and cardiographic images, and patient-reported outcome measurement surveys1. Include a brief explanation of the relevant results with reference ranges if necessary2. When trying to establish a cause and effect relationship between an exposure and a clinical event, document time course and dose of exposure to the onset of the clinical syndrome3 Important follow-up diagnostic assessments should be reported in the “Follow-up and Outcomes” section.\n\nA case report should, if possible, cite literature references that support or challenge the main diagnostic hypotheses. Other diagnostic challenges such as obstacles to completing the evaluation may be important to mention. Likewise, discuss the evidence for the prognosis which may be affected by factors such as histological and genetic abnormalities, concomitant diagnoses, and therapeutic interventions used. These can be further elaborated in the discussion section.",

There were no abnormalities noted along the course of either cranial seventh nerve. Her left STAB incision did not show evidence of thrombus, inflammation, or giant cells and hence was without evidence of temporal arteritis.”\n\nFrom Branch facial nerve trauma after superficial temporal artery biopsy: a case report4.\n\n\n8b—Diagnostic challenges (e.g., financial, language, or cultural)\n\n“Delay of diagnosis resulted in a severe gradual deterioration in our patient. His initial clinical diagnosis of muscular dystrophy was further confirmed with diagnostic studies, according to the family, although we acknowledge that another muscle biopsy may be needed to exclude a diagnosis of muscular dystrophy (though we doubt that this was the actual diagnosis). As a result of the original diagnosis, however, our patient did not seek further evaluation for several years because he understood that there was no treatment for his condition. Decades later, further work-up with simple imaging techniques easily confirmed the etiology of his symptoms. Unfortunately, this delay in diagnosis resulted in the development of irreversible severe chronic muscle wasting. With such advanced atrophy and severe weakness, surgery will likely not provide significant functional benefit.\nThe differential diagnosis of bibrachial atrophy and syringomyelia is important. While we cannot definitively exclude that both the cervicothoracic syringomyelia and the bibrachial amyotrophy occurred as two separate entities, we doubt this…. We do not know why our patient’ s symptoms were stable for over 20 years. Although there was no history of any preceding head or neck trauma, perhaps the syrinx rapidly enlarged in the process of the disease. Without prior imaging, this is impossible to say with any certainty.”\n\nFrom Chiari malformation type I with cervicothoracic syringomyelia masquerading as bibrachial amyotrophy: a case report5.\n\n\n8c—Diagnostic reasoning including other diagnoses considered\n\n“Differential diagnosis.\nTaking carefully into account the previous in-depth history of both patients, a molecular analysis of the MEFV gene was decided. A rapid screening test of the entire coding sequence of MEFV gene, combined with targeted sequencing, revealed that both patients suffered from FMF as no other etiology had been identified thus far, whereas there was an appropriate exclusion of infectious, malignant, autoimmune, rheumatic, and liver and biliary diseases at their last submission. Actually, the mutational analysis revealed that the male patient carried the R202Q/R202Q homozygous alteration in exon 2 of the MEFV gene, whereas the female young patient was heterozygous for the M694V/0 conservative mutation in exon 10 and homozygous for the R202Q/R202Q mutation in exon 2.”\n\nFrom Severe liver involvement in two patients with long-term history of fever: remember familial Mediterranean fever6.\n\n\n8d—Prognostic characteristics (e.g., staging) where applicable\n\n“Procalcitonin is a useful tool in the early diagnosis of sepsis, differentiating from other inflammatory syndrome. The high PCT level (10 ng/mL) in this case could suggest serious bacterial infection and sepsis and also predicts mortality and worse outcome.”\n\nFrom Procalcitonin as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for sepsis caused by intestinal infection: a case report.7",

The abstract also aids indexing and identification of case reports in electronic databases4.\nThe case report’ abstract first briefly summarizes the background information in a sentence or two to orient the reader to the relationship between existing knowledge and the case. Second, the case report identifies the focus of the case report and summarizes this episode of care. Finally, the abstract concludes with one to two sentences that highlight the &gt; “take-away” lesson from the case report, with an emphasis on a single priority message5,6.\nWhen written last, the abstract can often more accurately reflect the completed case report. Medical journals vary in their requirements for an unstructured versus a structured abstract. A structured abstract for a case report typically includes three sections: the introduction, case presentation, and conclusion1,3.",

This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies, it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS.”\n\nFrom Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)7.\n\n\nStructured\n\n“Introduction: We report an adolescent boy with minimal pre-existing risk for thromboses who suffered central retinal vein occlusion associated with isotretinoin use for acne. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of this association.\nCase presentation: An otherwise healthy 17-year-old white man who was treated with systemic isotretinoin for recalcitrant acne was referred with central retinal vein occlusion in one eye. Although a detailed investigation was negative, DNA testing revealed that the patient was a heterozygous carrier of the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene. Despite the fact that this particular mutation is thought to represent only a minor risk factor for thromboses, it is probable that isotretinoin treatment greatly increased the risk of a vaso-occlusive incident in this patient.\nConclusion: Isotretinoin use may be associated with sight- and life-threatening thrombotic adverse effects even in young patients with otherwise minimal thrombophilic risk. Physicians should be aware of such potential dangers.”\n\nFrom Association between isotretinoin use and central retinal vein occlusion in an adolescent with minor predisposition for thrombotic incidents: a case report8.",

Describing how assumptions were assessed and whether these assumptions are met by the data enables readers to assess the suitability of the statistical approach used. If the assumptions are incorrect, the conclusions may not be valid. For example, the assumptions for data used in parametric tests (such as a t test, z test, ANOVA, etc.) are that the data are continuous, the residuals from the analysis are normally distributed, the responses are independent, and different groups have similar variances.\nThere are various tests for normality, for example, the Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. However, these tests have to be used cautiously. If the sample size is small, they will struggle to detect non-normality; if the sample size is large, the tests will detect unimportant deviations. An alternative approach is to evaluate data with visual plots, e.g., normal probability plots, box plots, scatterplots. If the residuals of the analysis are not normally distributed, the assumption may be satisfied using a data transformation in which the same mathematical function is applied to all data points to produce normally distributed data (e.g., loge, log10, square root).\nOther types of outcome measures (binary, categorical, or ordinal) will require different methods of analysis, and each will have different sets of assumptions. For example, categorical data are summarised by counts and percentages or proportions and are analysed by tests of proportions; these analysis methods assume that data are binary, ordinal or nominal, and independent1.\nFor each statistical test used (parametric or nonparametric), report the type of outcome measure and the methods used to test the assumptions of the statistical approach. If data were transformed, identify precisely the transformation used and which outcome measures it was applied to. Report any changes to the analysis if the assumptions were not met and an alternative approach was used (e.g., a nonparametric test was used, which does not require the assumption of normality). If the relevant assumptions about the data were not tested, state this explicitly.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nUsing appropriate randomisation methods during the allocation to groups ensures that each experimental unit has an equal probability of receiving a particular treatment and provides balanced numbers in each treatment group. Selecting an animal ‘at random’ (i.e., haphazardly or arbitrarily) from a cage is not statistically random, as the process involves human judgement. It can introduce bias that influences the results, as a researcher may (consciously or subconsciously) make judgements in allocating an animal to a particular group, or because of unknown and uncontrolled differences in the experimental conditions or animals in different groups. Using a validated method of randomisation helps minimise selection bias and reduce systematic differences in the characteristics of animals allocated to different groups1–3. Inferential statistics based on nonrandomised group allocation are not valid4,5. Thus, the use of randomisation is a prerequisite for any experiment designed to test a hypothesis. Examples of appropriate randomisation methods include online random number generators (e.g., https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1/) or a function like Rand() in spreadsheet software such as Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice. The EDA has a dedicated feature for randomisation and allocation concealment6.\nSystematic reviews have shown that animal experiments that do not report randomisation or other bias-reducing measures such as blinding are more likely to report exaggerated effects that meet conventional measures of statistical significance7–9. It is especially important to use randomisation in situations in which it is not possible to blind all or parts of the experiment, but even with randomisation, researcher bias can pervert the allocation. This can be avoided by using allocation concealment (see Item 5. Blinding). In studies in which sample sizes are small, simple randomisation may result in unbalanced groups; here, randomisation strategies to balance groups such as randomising in matched pairs10–12 and blocking are encouraged13. Reporting the precise method used to allocate animals or experimental units to groups enables readers to assess the reliability of the results and identify potential limitations.\nReport the type of randomisation used (simple, stratified, randomised complete blocks, etc.; see Section 3), the method used to generate the randomisation sequence (e.g., computer-generated randomisation sequence, with details of the algorithm or programme used), and what was randomised (e.g., treatment to experimental unit, order of treatment for each animal). If this varies between experiments, report this information specifically for each experiment. If randomisation was not the method used to allocate experimental units to groups, state this explicitly and explain how the groups being compared were formed.",

    "section": "Considerations for the randomisation strategy",
    "text": "Considerations for the randomisation strategy\n\nSimple randomisation\nAll animals/samples are simultaneously randomised to the treatment groups without considering any other variable. This strategy is rarely appropriate, as it cannot ensure that comparison groups are balanced for other variables that might influence the result of an experiment.\n\n\nRandomisation within blocks\nBlocking is a method of controlling natural variation among experimental units. This splits up the experiment into smaller subexperiments (blocks), and treatments are randomised to experimental units within each block5,13,14. This takes into account nuisance variables that could potentially bias the results (e.g., cage location, day or week of procedure).\nStratified randomisation uses the same principle as randomisation within blocks, only the strata tend to be traits of the animal that are likely to be associated with the response (e.g., weight class or tumour size class). This can lead to differences in the practical implementation of stratified randomisation as compared with block randomisation (e.g., there may not be equal numbers of experimental units in each weight class).\n\n\nOther randomisation strategies\nMinimisation is an alternative strategy to allocate animals/samples to treatment group to balance variables that might influence the result of an experiment. With minimisation, the treatment allocated to the next animal/sample depends on the characteristics of those animals/samples already assigned. The aim is that each allocation should minimise the imbalance across multiple factors15. This approach works well for a continuous nuisance variable such as body weight or starting tumour volume.\n\n\nExamples of nuisance variables that can be accounted for in the randomisation strategy\n\nTime or day of the experiment\nLitter, cage, or fish tank\nInvestigator or surgeon—different level of experience in the people administering the treatments, performing the surgeries, or assessing the results may result in varying stress levels in the animals or duration of anaesthesia\nEquipment (e.g., PCR machine, spectrophotometer)—calibration may vary\nMeasurement of a study parameter (e.g., initial tumour volume)\nAnimal characteristics (e.g., sex, age bracket, weight bracket)\nLocation—exposure to light, ventilation, and disturbances may vary in cages located at different height or on different racks, which may affect important physiological processes\n\n\n\nImplication for the analysis\nIf blocking factors are used in the randomisation, they should also be included in the analysis. Nuisance variables increase variability in the sample, which reduces statistical power. Including a nuisance variable as a blocking factor in the analysis accounts for that variability and can increase the power, thus increasing the ability to detect a real effect with fewer experimental units. However, blocking uses up degrees of freedom and thus reduces the power if the nuisance variable does not have a substantial impact on variability.",

    "text": "Explanation\nIn a hypothesis-testing experiment, the primary outcome measure answers the main biological question. It is the outcome of greatest importance, identified in the planning stages of the experiment and used as the basis for the sample size calculation (see Item 2b. Sample Size). For exploratory studies, it is not necessary to identify a single primary outcome, and often multiple outcomes are assessed (see Item 13. Objectives).\nIn a hypothesis-testing study powered to detect an effect on the primary outcome measure, data on secondary outcomes are used to evaluate additional effects of the intervention, but subsequent statistical analysis of secondary outcome measures may be underpowered, making results and interpretation less reliable1,2. Studies that claim to test a hypothesis but do not specify a predefined primary outcome measure or those that change the primary outcome measure after data were collected (also known as primary outcome switching) are liable to selectively report only statistically significant results, favouring more positive findings3.\nRegistering a protocol in advance protects the researcher against concerns about selective outcome reporting (also known as data dredging or p-hacking) and provides evidence that the primary outcome reported in the manuscript accurately reflects what was planned4 (see Item 19. Protocol registration).\nIn studies using inferential statistics to test a hypothesis (e.g., t test, ANOVA), if more than one outcome was assessed, explicitly identify the primary outcome measure, state whether it was defined as such prior to data collection and whether it was used in the sample size calculation. If there was no primary outcome measure, explicitly state so.",

    "text": "Explanation\nExplaining the purpose of the study by describing the question(s) that the research addresses allows readers to determine whether the study is relevant to them. Readers can also assess the relevance of the model organism, procedures, outcomes measured, and analysis used.\nKnowing whether a study is exploratory or hypothesis-testing is critical to its interpretation. A typical exploratory study may measure multiple outcomes and look for patterns in the data or relationships that can be used to generate hypotheses. It may also be a pilot study, which aims to inform the design or feasibility of larger subsequent experiments. Exploratory research helps researchers to design hypothesis-testing experiments by choosing what variables or outcome measures to focus on in subsequent studies.\nTesting a specific hypothesis has implications for both the study design and the data analysis1,2. For example, an experiment designed to detect a hypothesised effect will likely need to be analysed with inferential statistics, and a statistical estimation of the sample size will need to be performed a priori (see Item 2. Sample size). Hypothesis-testing studies also have a predefined primary outcome measure, which is used to assess the evidence in support of the specific research question (see Item 6. Outcome measures).\nIn contrast, exploratory research investigates many possible effects and is likely to yield more false positive results because some will be positive by chance. Thus, results from well-designed hypothesis-testing studies provide stronger evidence than those from exploratory or descriptive studies. Independent replication and meta-analysis can further increase the confidence in conclusions.\nClearly outline the objective(s) of the study, including whether it is hypothesis-testing or exploratory, or if it includes research of both types. Hypothesis-testing studies may collect additional information for exploratory purposes; it is important to distinguish which hypotheses were prespecified and which originated after data inspection, especially when reporting unanticipated effects or outcomes that were not part of the original study design.",

Negative controls are used to determine whether a difference between groups is caused by the intervention (e.g., wild-type animals versus genetically modified animals, placebo versus active treatment, sham surgery versus surgical intervention). Positive controls can be used to support the interpretation of negative results or determine if an expected effect is detectable.\nIt may not be necessary to include a separate control with no active treatment if, for example, the experiment aims to compare a treatment administered by different methods (e.g., intraperitoneal administration versus oral gavage) or animals that are used as their own control in a longitudinal study. A pilot study, such as one designed to test the feasibility of a procedure, might also not require a control group.\nFor complex study designs, a visual representation is more easily interpreted than a text description, so a timeline diagram or flowchart is recommended. Diagrams facilitate the identification of which treatments and procedures were applied to specific animals or groups of animals and at what point in the study these were performed. They also help to communicate complex design features such as whether factors are crossed or nested (hierarchical/multilevel designs), blocking (to reduce unwanted variation, see Item 4. Randomisation), or repeated measurements over time on the same experimental unit (repeated measures designs); see2 for more information on different design types. The Experimental Design Assistant (EDA) is a platform to support researchers in the design of in vivo experiments; it can be used to generate diagrams to represent any type of experimental design3.\nFor each experiment performed, clearly report all groups used. Selectively excluding some experimental groups (for example, because the data are inconsistent or conflict with the narrative of the paper) is misleading and should be avoided4. Ensure that test groups, comparators, and controls (negative or positive) can be identified easily.

    "text": "Explanation\nThe species, strain, substrain, sex, weight, and age of animals are critical factors that can influence most experimental results1–5. Reporting the characteristics of all animals used is equivalent to standardised human patient demographic data; these data support both the internal and external validity of the study results. It enables other researchers to repeat the experiment and generalise the findings. It also enables readers to assess whether the animal characteristics chosen for the experiment are relevant to the research objectives.\nWhen reporting age and weight, include summary statistics for each experimental group (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and, if possible, baseline values for individual animals (e.g., as supplementary information or a link to a publicly accessible data repository). As body weight might vary during the course of the study, indicate when the measurements were taken. For most species, precise reporting of age is more informative than a description of the developmental status (e.g., a mouse referred to as an adult can vary in age from 6 to 20 weeks6). In some cases, however, reporting the developmental stage is more informative than chronological age—for example, in juvenile Xenopus, in which rate of development can be manipulated by incubation temperature7.\nReporting the weight or the sex of the animals used may not feasible for all studies. For example, sex may be unknown for embryos or juveniles, or weight measurement may be particularly stressful for some aquatic species. If reporting these characteristics can be reasonably expected for the species used and the experimental setting but are not reported, provide a justification.",

    "text": "Explanation\nAnimals, experimental units, or data points that are unaccounted for can lead to instances in which conclusions cannot be supported by the raw data1. Reporting exclusions and attritions provides valuable information to other investigators evaluating the results or who intend to repeat the experiment or test the intervention in other species. It may also provide important safety information for human trials (e.g., exclusions related to adverse effects).\nThere are many legitimate reasons for experimental attrition, some of which are anticipated and controlled for in advance (see subitem 3a on defining exclusion and inclusion criteria), but some data loss might not be anticipated. For example, data points may be excluded from analyses because of an animal receiving the wrong treatment, unexpected drug toxicity, infections or diseases unrelated to the experiment, sampling errors (e.g., a malfunctioning assay that produced a spurious result, inadequate calibration of equipment), or other human error (e.g., forgetting to switch on equipment for a recording).\nMost statistical analysis methods are extremely sensitive to outliers and missing data. In some instances, it may be scientifically justifiable to remove outlying data points from an analysis, such as obvious errors in data entry or measurement with readings that are outside a plausible range. Inappropriate data cleaning has the potential to bias study outcomes2; providing the reasoning for removing data points enables the distinction to be made between responsible data cleaning and data manipulation. Missing data, common in all areas of research, can impact the sensitivity of the study and also lead to biased estimates, distorted power, and loss of information if the missing values are not random3. Analysis plans should include methods to explore why data are missing. It is also important to consider and justify analysis methods that account for missing data4,5.\nThere is a movement toward greater data sharing (see Item 20. Data access), along with an increase in strategies such as code sharing to enable analysis replication. These practices, however transparent, still need to be accompanied by a disclosure on the reasoning for data cleaning and whether methods were defined before any data were collected.\nReport all animal exclusions and loss of data points, along with the rationale for their exclusion. For example, this information can be summarised as a table or a flowchart describing attrition in each treatment group. Accompanying this information should be an explicit description of whether researchers were blinded to the group allocations when data or animals were excluded (see Item 5. Blinding and6). Explicitly state when built-in models in statistics packages have been used to remove outliers (e.g., GraphPad Prism’s outlier test).",

    "text": "Explanation\nA data-sharing statement describes how others can access the data on which the paper is based. Sharing adequately annotated data allows others to replicate data analyses so that results can be independently tested and verified. Data sharing allows the data to be repurposed and new datasets to be created by combining data from multiple studies (e.g., to be used in secondary analyses). This allows others to explore new topics and increases the impact of the study, potentially preventing unnecessary use of animals and providing more value for money. Access to raw data also facilitates text and automated data mining1.\nAn increasing number of publishers and funding bodies require authors or grant holders to make their data publicly available2. Journal articles with accompanying data may be cited more frequently3,4. Datasets can also be independently cited in their own right, which provides additional credit for authors. This practice is gaining increasing recognition and acceptance5.\nWhen possible, make available all data that contribute to summary estimates or claims presented in the paper. Data should follow the FAIR guiding principles6; that is, data are findable, accessible (i.e., do not use outdated file types), interoperable (can be used on multiple platforms and with multiple software packages), and reusable (i.e., have adequate data descriptors).\nData can be made publicly available via a structured, specialised (domain-specific), open-access repository such as those maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/). If such a repository is not available, data can be deposited in unstructured but publicly available repositories (e.g., Figshare https://figshare.com/, Dryad https://datadryad.org/, Zenodo https://zenodo.org/, or Open Science Framework https://osf.io/).

    "text": "Explanation\nA transparent and accurate abstract increases the utility and impact of the manuscript and allows readers to assess the reliability of the study1. The abstract is often used as a screening tool by readers to decide whether to read the full article or whether to select an article for inclusion in a systematic review. However, abstracts often either do not contain enough information for this purpose2 or contain information that is inconsistent with the results in the rest of the manuscript3,4. In systematic reviews, initial screens to identify papers are based on titles, abstracts, and keywords5. Leaving out of the abstract information such as the species of animal used or the drugs being tested limits the value of preclinical systematic reviews as relevant studies cannot be identified and included. For example, in a systematic review of the effect of the MVA85A vaccine on tuberculosis challenge in animals, the largest preclinical trial did not include the vaccine name in the abstract or keywords of the publication; the paper was only included in the systematic review following discussions with experts in the field6.\nTo maximise utility, include details of the species, sex, and strain of animals used and accurately report the methods, results, and conclusions of the study. Also describe the objectives of the study, including whether it was designed either to test a specific hypothesis or to generate a new hypothesis (see Item 13. Objectives). Incorporating this information will enable readers to interpret the strength of evidence and judge how the study fits within the wider knowledge base.",

    "text": "Examples\n\n’Background and Purpose\n’Asthma is an inflammatory disease that involves airway hyperresponsiveness and remodelling. Flavonoids have been associated to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and may represent a potential therapeutic treatment of asthma. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the sakuranetin treatment in several aspects of experimental asthma model in mice.\n’Experimental Approach\n’Male BALB/c mice received ovalbumin (i.p.) on days 0 and 14, and were challenged with aerolized ovalbumin 1% on days 24, 26 and 28. Ovalbumin-sensitized animals received vehicle (saline and dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO), sakuranetin (20 mg kg–1 per mice) or dexamethasone (5 mg kg–1 per mice) daily beginning from 24th to 29th day. Control group received saline inhalation and nasal drop vehicle. On day 29, we determined the airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodelling as well as specific IgE antibody. RANTES, IL- 5, IL -4, Eotaxin, IL -10, TNF -α, IFN -γ and GMC-SF content in lung homogenate was performed by Bioplex assay, and 8-isoprostane and NF -kB activations were visualized in inflammatory cells by immunohistochemistry.\n’Key Results\n’We have demonstrated that sakuranetin treatment attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodelling; and these effects could be attributed to Th2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress reduction as well as control of NF -kB activation.\n’Conclusions and Implications\n‘These results highlighted the importance of counteracting oxidative stress by flavonoids in this asthma model and suggest sakuranetin as a potential candidate for studies of treatment of asthma’7.\n\n\n‘In some parts of the world, the laboratory pig (Sus scrofa) is often housed in individual, sterile housing which may impose stress. Our objectives were to determine the effects of isolation and enrichment on pigs housed within the PigTurn®—a novel penning system with automated blood sampling—and to investigate tear staining as a novel welfare indicator. Twenty Yorkshire × Landrace weaner pigs were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial combination of enrichment (non-enriched NE or enriched E) and isolation (visually isolated I or able to see another pig NI). Pigs were catheterised and placed into the PigTurns® 48 h post recovery. Blood was collected automatically twice daily to determine white blood cell (WBC) differential counts and assayed for cortisol. Photographs of the eyes were taken daily and tear staining was quantified using a 0–5 scoring scale and Image-J software to measure stain area and perimeter. Behaviour was video recorded and scan sampled to determine time budgets. Data were analysed as an REML using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Enrichment tended to increase proportion of time standing and lying laterally and decrease plasma cortisol, tear-stain area and perimeter. There was a significant isolation by enrichment interaction. Enrichment given to pigs housed in isolation had no effect on plasma cortisol, but greatly reduced it in non-isolated pigs. Tear-staining area and perimeter were highest in the NE-I treatment compared to the other three treatments. Eosinophil count was highest in the E-NI treatment and lowest in the NE-I treatment. The results suggest that in the absence of enrichment, being able to see another animal but not interact may be frustrating. The combination of no enrichment and isolation maximally impacted tear staining and eosinophil numbers. However, appropriate enrichment coupled with proximity of another pig would appear to improve welfare’8.",

    "text": "John Doe – Early Career Researcher\nAs someone who’s new to academic writing, I honestly didn’t know where to start—I didn’t have a writing process, and staring at the blank page felt overwhelming. I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to include or how best to structure it all. My PhD supervisor suggested I use a reporting guideline, and they were a total game-changer. They gave me something concrete to work with—like a to-do list that helped me get past that initial block and start putting information down on the page.\nThe first time I used one, I found it a bit tricky. It felt like a lot to take in, and although it helped me jot down information, my manuscript felt really long and a bit disjointed. But then I realised I didn’t have to follow it rigidly like a script. It was just a starting point. Once I had the key information written out, I could decide how best to organise it to make the paper flow well. Some things worked better in a table, some in the main text, and I moved a few details into the supplementary materials. That flexibility made it feel much more manageable.\nI was also a bit nervous about being too transparent—especially when it came to discussing limitations. But I’ve come to realise that journals and reviewers (and my supervisor and viva assessors!) really value honesty and thoughtful reflection. It shows that you understand your work deeply and are engaging with it critically. Overall, using reporting guidelines has made me feel much more confident and in control of the writing process."

    "text": "Jane Doe – Experienced Researcher\nI first came across reporting guidelines when a journal asked me to complete a checklist at the point of submission. At the time, I found it a bit annoying—after spending weeks refining and polishing the manuscript, the idea of going back to adjust the structure or add missing details felt like frustrating red tape. I completed the checklist, of course, but it felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than something helpful.\nThe next time I wrote a paper, I decided to use the relevant reporting guideline right from the start—just to see if it made the process smoother. It turned out to be a really practical tool. Having a clear list of what information to include made it easier to draft the paper, and I found myself making fewer revisions later on. Over time, using guidelines has become second nature. I now refer to them not just when writing papers, but also when planning new studies, preparing funding applications, and writing protocols. By the time I get to the journal submission stage, completing the checklist is quick and reassuring—I already know I’ve covered what’s important.\nI also use reporting guidelines when teaching my students how to write. For researchers who are still developing their writing habits, these guidelines provide structure and clarity. They help demystify what’s expected and build a strong foundation for clear, transparent research communication. If you’re just starting out, I’d really encourage you to give them a try—not just at the end of your writing, but as a tool to guide you from the beginning. It’s made a big difference to my work"

I’ve instructed my editorial and peer review teams to check all submissions against the appropriate reporting guidelines, whether that’s CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, or another guideline. They use these guidelines to assess whether key information is present, clear, and transparent—such as how the study was conducted, who was involved, what interventions were used, and how outcomes were measured. We don’t expect every study to be perfect—research is complex, and limitations are inevitable—but we do expect authors to report their work fully and honestly. A clearly reported study, with a thoughtful discussion of its limitations, is far more valuable to the scientific community than one that hides its flaws. Reporting guidelines help ensure that published research can be understood, used, built upon, and cited—and that’s essential for real-world impact, and essential to maintaining our reputation as a leading journal."

To help maintain quality and consistency, our team typically selects a few items at random from the checklist and cross-checks them against the manuscript to ensure the information is actually there.

    "text": "June Doe – Peer reviewer and evidence synthesiser\nWhen I peer review manuscripts for journals, I always refer to reporting guidelines to check whether the study has been reported clearly and completely. These guidelines help me spot missing details—things like how the sample was selected, exactly what interventions were used, or how outcomes were measured. I also recommend reporting guidelines to junior colleagues who are new to peer reviewing—they’re a great way to structure your review and make sure you’re thorough. Although I always remind my colleagues that checking for adherence to a reporting guideline is only the first step of a good review. Information has to be present before you can consider the strengths and weaknesses of research.\nI ask authors to fill in those gaps, not just so I can properly assess the quality and validity of the research, but because I know those details matter to other people down the line. Even if something doesn’t seem essential for the initial peer review, including it helps ensure your work is usable, reproducible, and ultimately more impactful.\nFor example, I do a lot of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of health research. To do my job effectively, I need to be able to find relevant studies, understand exactly what was done, extract key information, and compare results across multiple papers. When articles are poorly reported — e.g., the intervention isn’t clearly defined, the patient group isn’t described, or key terms are missing from the title and abstract — it can be incredibly difficult to even locate them through database searches. If important details are vague or missing, I may have to exclude the study altogether because I can’t be confident about what was done or how it fits with the other evidence. That not only weakens the quality of the review, but also means the original study misses out on being cited or informing future research and policy. The research articles that are most useful to me are the ones where all the key information is clearly reported, limitations are acknowledged, and reporting guidelines have been followed. These are the studies I can include, cite, and build on—so they ultimately have more influence and impact."

    "text": "Professor Hywel Williams, Clinical Trials Editor of the Journal of Investigative Dermatology\nThe Journal of Investigative Dermatology (JID) is the leading scientific dermatology journal with an impact factor of 5.25 in 2008. The JID publishes original research on all aspects of cutaneous biology and skin disease. Although the majority of the journal content deals with basic science, its scope includes clinical research, clinical trials and epidemiology. I have been fortunate in working for the JID for the last 6 years as section editor, with particular responsibilities for clinical trials. In 2006, the JID made a clear announcement that it would welcome high quality clinical trial submissions, providing they were registered prospectively and that they adhered to the CONSORT checklist.\nStating such intent is all very well, but how does a journal like the JID go about implementing CONSORT and compulsory trial registration and how does it check on compliance to CONSORT?\nThis is how we did it. I first met with the Managing Editor, Elizabeth Blalock. We devised a system whereby submissions referring to clinical trials are reviewed by the JID office for trial registration details and adherence to CONSORT (i.e., submission of CONSORT checklist, flowchart, and appropriate manuscript headings). When the editorial office is in doubt whether the submission is a therapeutic trial (which is not always easy with studies that mainly look at disease mechanisms), the staff sends me the article to check. If it is deemed to be a therapeutic trial, then the editorial office contacts the authors for proof of trial registration and adherence to CONSORT prior to admitting the manuscript for peer review. Only those submissions in compliance with the full CONSORT (and journal) requirements are sent for content and methodological peer review. Otherwise, I send a note to the Editor-in-Chief recommending immediate rejection.\nThe project has been quite successful with little additional resource implications. The editorial staff (two members) have had to undertake some additional work in screening submissions and querying those they are unsure of, but they have enjoyed the work and they have acquired some new skills in assessing good clinical trial reporting. Most of the work ie explaining where in the document key items have been reported, is pushed back to the authors. The authors are highly motivated to do this as they know that the manuscript will not be processed further until they have met these requirements (which are clearly placed on the journal’s online author instructions). Whilst it is true that the JID publishes few trials, those that are published are of high quality.\nOn a personal level, the project has been good fun, and has meant little additional work to my role as section editor with responsibilities for clinical trials. In fact, it has made my job of checking manuscripts much easier as I can quickly see where on the manuscript the key CONSORT items are meant to be described. It is clear from some of the submissions that some authors have not heard about trial prospective trial registration. When queried, some authors try and register their trial retrospectively after the analysis has been carried out, which defies the purpose of registration. Such papers are returned by the Editor to the authors without further review. I hope this model of working with journal editorial staff teams can help other journals improve reporting of trials in an efficient way. The key ingredients are (i) a committed journal editor (ii) editorial staff willing to take on new roles and (iii) a section editor with an interest in clinical trials to take responsibility for being arbiter for checks and borderline decisions."

    "section": "Jason Roberts, PhD is Managing Editor, Headache",
    "text": "Jason Roberts, PhD is Managing Editor, Headache\nEdited by John Rothrock, MD and publishing 10 times a year, Headache is the official publication of the American Headache Society. It receives several hundred manuscripts annually, with roughly 35% of submissions arriving, respectively, from both North America and Europe. Roughly 60% of submissions report clinical trials, multi-patient case series or constitute a systematic overview. The majority of content is of a clinical nature but a small proportion of papers are oriented towards the basic sciences. The journal has an Impact Factor that places it just inside the top-third of titles ranked by ISI within Clinical Neurology. In short, it is a typical mid-sized journal.\nDuring 2008, the Headache editorial office undertook a critique of its publishing output over the previous decade. We found several cases of otherwise good papers that had failed to report research methodologies satisfactorily or omitted crucial information that hindered study replication. While this review of previously published material was ongoing, we also began to experience a surge in the volume of submissions. Nearly one-third of 2008 submissions were from authors new to Headache. Unfortunately, it seemed a sizeable proportion of these new papers contained weak methodological reporting (often to the detriment of otherwise interesting research).\nIn an effort to elevate the quality of material Headache published, we decided to overhaul our submission and peer review processes. An aggressive stance was taken: we would ask authors to work harder to improve the quality of their reporting. We also renewed a commitment to our authors to burnish potentially interesting papers. To achieve these twin objectives, we decided to mandate the inclusion of a reporting checklist for all submissions. We hoped the guidelines would compel authors to include pertinent methodological details that in turn would deliver a more uniform standard of reporting across manuscripts. Completion of the checklists would then serve to document where critical reporting elements were recorded in a manuscript, which would assist manuscript evaluation. The provision of reporting guidelines would have the dual purpose of making it clear to authors what the minimum threshold was for publication and aid our reviewers/editorial board in enforcing these standards as part of the peer review process. We took to heart the entreaty of Doug Altman, that though responsibility for good reporting rests with authors, journals have a role to play.\n\nLaunching an Effort to Collect Reporting Checklists\nTo institute this new policy, the editorial office was charged with three tasks: establish which checklists could be employed (step 1); devise a method of collection (step 2) and educate our author base of the benefits of utilizing checklists (step 3).\n\nStep 1\nSome reporting guidelines were well known to us (CONSORT, STARD) but we needed to explore the full range of options. This led us to EQUATOR. EQUATOR’s site was especially useful during this formative stage because it contained a tremendous depth of material from the checklists themselves through to editorials from journals that had already implemented reporting procedures. In reviewing established guidelines we determined 8 were of importance to us (see table 1).\n\n\nStep 2\nAfter selecting the reporting guidelines to be used, the next challenge was to establish a method of collection to accommodate our desire to see guideline adherence and checklist completion as a mandatory exercise. Headache uses the Manuscript Central online submission system, but the challenges of collecting forms through the submission site are similar for other products, such as Editorial Manager, Benchpress and EES. A new step was to be inserted into the online submission process. Authors would identify their study type (for example, Randomized Controlled Pharmacotherapy trials, Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies). The submission system would then respond by providing the appropriate checklist for the author to download and complete (all forms are MS Word documents). The author then has to upload the completed form as part of their submission.\nThe system was re-engineered in such a way that submission was not possible until a checklist file was uploaded. As the Manuscript Central system did not have an inbuilt workflow template to handle our demands at that time, we had to work with the system programmers to have the system configured appropriately.\n\n\n\nStep 3\nAssociated with the launch of the checklist mandate was a program to educate our authors, reviewers and readers. Two editorial board members, upon the launch o f the new reporting policies, published an editorial outlining our official position:\n\nGood reports should contain a clear explanation of the study methods, describe statistical techniques in enough detail to allow verification of the results from original data, report all results, and interpret and present findings in a balanced and forthright way.\n\nAdditionally, the journal editorial office has developed a workshop to run at American Headache Society meetings that incorporates instruction on the benefits of utilizing reporting guidelines within a general conversation on how to write, and submit, a manuscript successfully.\nOur education efforts aim to ensure authors understand that completion of a reporting checklist is not the important task. Instead, it is ensuring the guidelines are used constructively to shape the construction of an article. There is a sense that some authors are not able to make that distinction and see the checklists as an administrative barrier to submission.\n\n\nBenefits of Instituting Reporting Guidelines\nAs only one year has passed since we mandated the reporting checklist requirement, we do not yet have sufficient data to report on the apparent success of the policy beyond anecdotal evidence. Our intentions in launching the policy were to: improve the quality of research reporting amongst the submissions we received; aid reviewers in their evaluation of a manuscript and assist the decision-making process. First and foremost, we wanted to ensure that every critical element involved in data collection, where appropriate, was documented in a manuscript and recorded on a checklist. We were realistic and understood that reporting guidelines per se may not improve the overall quality of the paper, but we contended that forcing authors to record critical information regarding data collection enabled us to better judge the scientific merit of the article. It is still too early to assess if authors recognize the benefits of reporting guidelines. We have been conscious of pitching the imposition of a reporting policy as an aid to improving an author’s submission and not an administrative task.\nThe consensus amongst editorial board members has been that the checklists are facilitating the peer review process – indeed there is early observational evidence to suggest the checklists themselves are shaping some of the reviews returned as some reviewers structure comments around issues raised in the reporting guidelines. Again, anecdotally, individual editorial board members reported several cases where they felt that following a round of revision, reporting guides had improved several papers by highlighting omissions of important information."

    "text": "What are reporting guidelines?\nReporting guidelines are recommendations of information to include when writing up research. They ensure research can be understood and used by a wide audience including other researchers, editors, reviewers, clinicians, evidence synthesisers, and readers from different fields, countries, or background, even decades in the future.\nReporting guidelines help researchers write academic articles, protocols, and funding applications. They make writing less daunting by breaking the process up into bite-size chunks, without dictating the final structure. They help authors lay out the key information – the building blocks – of their work. Authors then decide how best to arrange this information to build a compelling and clear account.\nHowever, reporting guidelines are not design standards or tools for quality appraisal. They do not dictate how research must be conducted, but they do ensure research is described clearly enough for readers to understand its strengths and limitations.\nWhy do we need them? Because for decades, researchers have missed out important details because of oversight, or because they have not considered their audience’s needs. These gaps make it harder for others to replicate, understand, or apply the findings — and may exclude research from reviews or clinical use. This is a massive source of waste that pervades all research areas. Well-reported research has greater impact.\n\nReporting guidelines are made by expert groups. Most groups follow a systematic, consensus development method to create and publish a checklist, sometimes accompanied by a longer explanation paper that provides context and examples for each checklist item.\nTo make these resources easier to use, we at the EQUATOR Network built this website in collaboration with authors, editors, and the developers of the most-used open access reporting guidelines."

    "text": "Writing using reporting guidelines\nReporting guidelines help authors develop their writing practice to create articles and applications that are clear, compelling, and complete. They can be used alongside any writing process – whether you jump straight in with full paragraphs, or prefer to plan, outline, draft, and revise your text. Whether you write from introduction to discussion, or prefer to start by writing your methods or results.\nThey are especially useful to researchers with less writing experience, who haven’t found an approach to writing that works for them.\nThey break the writing process into manageable pieces. Read the guidance before you begin writing. If you like to plan your writing, consider working though items and collating notes into a document, then organise your notes into coherent structure with logical narrative structure.\nYou decide how best to arrange information, and whether to present it in the article body, in a figure or table, or in a supplement.\nTo learn more about writing skills, develop good writing habits, and how to use reporting guidelines, see our training."

    "section": "Reporting checklists",
    "text": "Reporting checklists\nReporting guideline checklists allow authors to demonstrate how their work complies with a reporting guideline. By including a completed checklist as supplementary material, authors can reassure editors and peer reviewers their article is complete. Publishing checklists as supplements also helps readers and evidence synthesisers to find and extract information.\nReporting checklists are best used at the end of writing, before journal submission. Specify where readers can find each reporting item by directing them to parts of the manuscript e.g.,\n\nMethods, para. 2\nTable 2\nSupplement A, para. 4 and Figure S1.\n\nSome older reporting checklists asked authors to state page numbers for each item. We recommend against this because:\n\nPage numbers easily change when editing a document.\nWhen you submit, most journals generate a PDF of your manuscript combined with other submission data. The page numbers in your checklist will not correspond to this PDF, and so won’t be useful to editors nor reviewers.\nWhen published, online articles don’t have pages and PDF pages won’t correspond to your original file, so page numbers won’t help readers.\n\nConversely, if you specify which section, paragraph, table, figure, or supplement contains a reporting guideline item, editors, peer reviewers, and future readers will easily be able to find it.\nIf you have chosen not to report an item, explain why. You can do this in the checklist, or as a note below it. Otherwise editors or peer reviewers may chase you for this information, thereby delaying publication. These explanations will also help future evidence reviewers – who commonly use reporting guidelines when assessing the the quality of reporting and risk of bias – meaning your article may be more likely to be included in their reviews.\nAs with reporting guidelines, checklists do not dictate how research should be conducted nor how manuscripts should be structured."

Nevertheless, all reporting guidelines can be used to write protocols or grant applications – just use the methods items. Although reporting guidelines don’t dictate how research should be designed or conducted, using them to write a protocol or application helps authors consider decisions they will encounter and to document their thoughts."

    "title": "Using Reporting Guidelines to Draft Research Articles: A Step-by-Step Guide",
    "section": "The writing process",
    "text": "The writing process\nIf you have ever taken a holiday, you will know there is a good way and a bad way to pack a suitcase.\nThe bad way is to fling things in, as and when you think of them. Rushed and stressed, the disorganised packer struggles to close their bloated bag and upon unpacking, their clothes are creased, possessions jumbled, and their toothbrush is forgotten at home.\nAn organised packer has a process. Often this begins with a list, laying everything out in front of you, then carefully deciding which items belong in the suitcase, which will go in carry-on, and how clothes can be folded to minimise space and creasing. The organised packer feels relaxed and enjoys their journey in the confidence that they’ve forgotten nothing.\nWriting academic articles is a lot like packing a suitcase. The author has to cram a lot of information into a small space, without crumpling the message they are trying to convey. Reporting guidelines act as the packing list, and the process we describe below covers the act of collating your stuff (information), laying it out (on the page), deciding what goes where (reorganising), and then finally, packing (writing a first draft).\n\nStep 1: Get the appropriate writing guide\nDownload the writing guide for the reporting guideline that matches your study design. For reporting guidelines not featured on this website, you can find their available resources by searching our database.\n\n\nStep 2: Collate information\nGather your research materials (e.g., your notes, data, analyses, protocol)\nFor each section in the writing guide:\n\nAnswers the prompting questions\nDocument any information that cannot be included and why\nIdentify information that would benefit from visual presentation.\n\nDraft tables.\nCollate figures that already exist. If custom figures need to be made, note down what information they should convey.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Content Organization and Prioritization\nBy now you may already have a target journal in mind. Review their author instructions for word limits, figure/table allowances, and supplementary material policies.\nBegin reorganising your notes into a structure that fits your narrative and priorities. You might prefer to do this in a new document, or to delete the provided writing guide section titles and prompts. Group your notes into paragraphs. Some authors like to assign word limits to paragraphs or sections at this stage. Consider adding topic and linking sentences to the start and end of each paragraph. This helps creates flow.\nWhen organising content, consider how important the information will be to most of your readers. Prioritise information you expect most readers will find important. Content you expect only a small section of your audience will seek out can be placed later in your writing, allocated less space or, if necessary, be placed in supplementary material. Do not delete any information – although you may consider it unimportant, every item in a reporting guideline is important to somebody.\nBy now, your notes should be grouped into paragraphs, separated into main text and supplementary materials, and be filled with all of the information, data, and sources you’ll need to write. You should have drafted your tables and planned your figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNow is a good moment to talk a colleague through your outline. Your notes will be brief and rough, but someone familiar with the work will be able to give feedback on your proposed structure and content.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Writing the First Draft\nOnce you are ready to start drafting, open a new document. Your writing guide is probably very long by now, so writing in a new document means you can maintain focus without deleting notes.\nWe suggest you begin by drafting the Methods section as this is generally the easiest to get started with, then the Results before the Introduction, Discussion and, finally, the Abstract and Title. When drafting, try not to use your delete key. The aim is get words on the page, no matter how messy they are. If you get stuck on something, consider using a placeholder (like #TODO) and come back to it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is another good moment to get feedback from colleagues. Give them your manuscript and ask whether the structure and flow make sense. Because it’s only a first draft, you may want to ask them to not worry about spelling, grammar, or conciseness.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Revision and editing\nReview the draft for logical flow between sections.\nEdit your text to make it clear, concise and engaging.\nOnce the text is ready to submit, complete the reporting checklist for the reporting guideline you used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is an opportunity for a final round of feedback from a colleague. You may want to ask them to do a more through edit of your writing, fixing any errors and reworking sentences for clarity and conciseness. Consider asking a colleague to complete the reporting checklist on their own as part of this review, or to look through the checklist you already completed. This will allow you to check whether your interpretation of the guidance requirements matches theirs, and whether you have presented information clearly.\n\n\nAdd the completed reporting checklist as a supplement, and ensure you have credited the reporting guideline, checklist, and writing guide.\n\n\nSubmission\nInclude your completed reporting checklist as a supplement when you submit to your chosen journal. If your target journal/funder do not accept supplementary material, you can upload your checklist to a repository like the OSF and cite it."

You can read how ARRIVE was developed in the FAQs.\n\n\n\nItem name\nWhat to write\n\n\n Essential 10\n\n\n\n 1. Study Design\n\n\n\n1a. The groups being compared\nFor each experiment, describe the groups being compared, including control groups. If you did not use a control group, explain why.\n\n\n1b. The experimental unit\nDescribe the experimental unit (e.g., a single animal, litter, or cage of animals).\n\n\n 2. Sample Size\n\n\n\n2a. Number of Experimental Units\nSpecify the exact number of experimental units allocated to each group, and the total number in each experiment. Also indicate the total number of animals used.\n\n\n2b. Sample Size Justification\nExplain how the sample size was decided. Provide details of any a priori sample size calculation, if done.\n\n\n 3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\n\n\n3a. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nDescribe any criteria used for including or excluding animals (or experimental units) during the experiment, and data points during the analysis. Specify if these criteria were established a priori. If no criteria were set, state this explicitly.\n\n\n3b. Exclusions and Attritions\nFor each experimental group, report any animals, experimental units, or data points not included in the analysis and explain why. If there were no exclusions, state so.\n\n\n3c. Numbers analysed\nFor each analysis, report the exact value of n in each experimental group.\n\n\n 4. Randomisation\n\n\n\n4a. Randomisation Use\nState whether randomisation was used to allocate experimental units to control and treatment groups. If done, provide the method used to generate the randomisation sequence.\n\n\n4b. Confounders\nDescribe the strategy used to minimise potential confounders such as the order of treatments and measurements, or animal/cage location. If confounders were not controlled, state this explicitly.\n\n\n5. Blinding/Masking\nDescribe who was aware of the group allocation at the different stages of the experiment (during the allocation, the conduct of the experiment, the outcome assessment, and the data analysis).\n\n\n 6. Outcome Measures\n\n\n\n6a. Outcome Measures\nClearly define all outcome measures assessed (e.g., cell death, molecular markers, or behavioural changes).\n\n\n6b. Primary Outcome Measure\nFor hypothesis-testing studies, specify the primary outcome measure, i.e., the outcome measure that was used to determine the sample size.\n\n\n 7. Statistical Methods\n\n\n\n7a. Statistical Methods used for each Analysis\nProvide details of the statistical methods used for each analysis, including software used.\n\n\n7b. Statistical Assumptions\nDescribe any methods used to assess whether the data met the assumptions of the statistical approach, and what was done if the assumptions were not met.\n\n\n 8. Experimental Animals\n\n\n\n8a. Species-appropriate Details\nProvide species-appropriate details of the animals used, including species, strain and substrain, sex, age or developmental stage, and, if relevant, weight.\n\n\n8b. Further Information\nProvide further relevant information on the provenance of animals, health/immune status, genetic modification status, genotype, and any previous procedures.\n\n\n 9. Experimental Procedures\n\n\n\n9a. What was done\nWhat was done, how it was done, and what was used.\n\n\n9b. When and how often procedures were conducted\nFor each experimental group, including controls, describe when and how often procedures were performed.\n\n\n9c. Where procedures were conducted\nFor each experimental group, including controls, describe where procedures were conducted (including detail of any acclimatisation periods).\n\n\n9d. Why procedures were done\nFor each experimental group, including controls, describe why procedures were conducted.\n\n\n 10. Results\n\n\n\n10a. Summary/Descriptive Statistics per group\nFor each experiment conducted, including independent replications, report a summary/descriptive statistics for each experimental group, with a measure of variability where applicable (e.g., mean and SD, or median and range).\n\n\n10b. Effect sizes and confidence intervals\nFor each experiment conducted, including independent replications, report the effect size with a confidence interval, if applicable.\n\n\n Recommended Set\n\n\n\n11. Abstract\nProvide an accurate summary of the research objectives, animal species, strain and sex, key methods, principal findings, and study conclusions.\n\n\n 12. Background\n\n\n\n12a. Rationale\nInclude sufficient scientific background to understand the rationale and context for the study, and explain the experimental approach.\n\n\n12b. Species and model\nExplain how the animal species and model used address the scientific objectives and, where appropriate, the relevance to human biology.\n\n\n13. Objectives\nClearly describe the research question, research objectives and, where appropriate, specific hypotheses being tested.\n\n\n14. Ethical statement\nProvide the name of the ethical review committee or equivalent that has approved the use of animals in this study and any relevant licence or protocol numbers (if applicable).

This is the use of non-human animals, sometimes known as model organisms, in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Animal research varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Source” The ARRIVE guidelines apply to all areas of bioscience research involving living animals. That includes mammalian species as well as model organisms such as Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans. Each item is equally relevant to manuscripts centred around a single animal study and broader-scope manuscripts describing in vivo observations along with other types of experiments. The exact type of detail to report, however, might vary between species and experimental setup; this is acknowledged in the guidance provided for each item.

They generally include a measure of central tendency (e.g., mean or median) and a measure of spread (e.g., standard deviation or range). Inferential statistics are used to make generalisations about the population from which the samples are drawn. Hypothesis tests such as ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, or t tests are examples of inferential statistics.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative measure of differences between groups, or strength of relationships between variables.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological entity subjected to an intervention independently of all other units, such that it is possible to assign any two experimental units to different treatment groups.

Independent variables can be scientifically interesting, or nuisance variables. Also known as predictor variable.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal validity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtent to which the results of a given study can be attributed to the effects of the experimental intervention, rather than some other, unknown factor(s) (e.g., inadequacies in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study introducing bias).Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuisance variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables that are not of primary interest but should be considered in the experimental design or the analysis because they may affect the outcome measure and add variability. They become confounders if, in addition, they are correlated with an independent variable of interest, as this introduces bias. Nuisance variables should be considered in the design of the experiment (to prevent them from becoming confounders) and in the analysis (to account for the variability and sometimes to reduce bias). For example, nuisance variables can be used as blocking factors or covariates.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull and alternative hypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no effect, such as a difference between groups or an association between variables.

    "text": "Explanation\nResearchers often expect a particular outcome and can unintentionally influence the experiment or interpret the data in such a way as to support their preferred hypothesis1. Blinding is a strategy used to minimise these subjective biases.\nAlthough there is primary evidence of the impact of blinding in the clinical literature that directly compares blinded versus unblinded assessment of outcomes2, there is limited empirical evidence in animal research3,4. There are, however, compelling data from systematic reviews showing that nonblinded outcome assessment leads to the treatment effects being overestimated, and the lack of bias-reducing measures such as randomisation and blinding can contribute to as much as 30%–45% inflation of effect sizes5–7.\nIdeally, investigators should be unaware of the treatment(s) animals have received or will be receiving, from the start of the experiment until the data have been analysed. If this is not possible for every stage of an experiment (see Section 3), it should always be possible to conduct at least some of the stages blind. This has implications for the organisation of the experiment and may require help from additional personnel—for example, a surgeon to perform interventions, a technician to code the treatment syringes for each animal, or a colleague to code the treatment groups for the analysis. Online resources are available to facilitate allocation concealment and blinding8.\nSpecify whether blinding was used or not for each step of the experimental process (see Section 3) and indicate what particular treatment or condition the investigators were blinded to, or aware of.\nIf blinding was not used at any of the steps outlined in Section 3, explicitly state this and provide the reason why blinding was not possible or not considered.",

    "text": "Blinding during different stages of an experiment\n\nDuring allocation\nAllocation concealment refers to concealing the treatment to be allocated to each individual animal from those assigning the animals to groups, until the time of assignment. Together with randomisation, allocation concealment helps minimise selection bias, which can introduce systematic differences between treatment groups.\n\n\nDuring the conduct of the experiment\nWhen possible, animal care staff and those who administer treatments should be unaware of allocation groups to ensure that all animals in the experiment are handled, monitored, and treated in the same way. Treating different groups differently based on the treatment they have received could alter animal behaviour and physiology and produce confounds.\nWelfare or safety reasons may prevent blinding of animal care staff, but in most cases, blinding is possible. For example, if hazardous microorganisms are used, control animals can be considered as dangerous as infected animals. If a welfare issue would only be tolerated for a short time in treated but not control animals, a harm-benefit analysis is needed to decide whether blinding should be used.\n\n\nDuring the outcome assessment\nThe person collecting experimental measurements or conducting assessments should not know which treatment each sample/animal received and which samples/animals are grouped together. Blinding is especially important during outcome assessment, particularly if there is a subjective element (e.g., when assessing behavioural changes or reading histological slides)3. Randomising the order of examination can also reduce bias.\nIf the person assessing the outcome cannot be blinded to the group allocation (e.g., obvious phenotypic or behavioural differences between groups), some, but not all, of the sources of bias could be mitigated by sending data for analysis to a third party who has no vested interest in the experiment and does not know whether a treatment is expected to improve or worsen the outcome.\n\n\nDuring the data analysis\nThe person analysing the data should know which data are grouped together to enable group comparisons but should not be aware of which specific treatment each group received. This type of blinding is often neglected but is important, as the analyst makes many semisubjective decisions such as applying data transformation to outcome measures, choosing methods for handling missing data, and handling outliers. How these decisions will be made should also be decided a priori.\nData can be coded prior to analysis so that the treatment group cannot be identified before analysis is completed.",

Identifying nuisance variables (sources of variability or conditions that could potentially bias results) and managing them in the design and analysis increases the sensitivity of the experiment. For example, rodents in cages at the top of the rack may be exposed to higher light levels, which can affect stress1.\nReporting the strategies implemented to minimise potential differences that arise between treatment groups during the course of the experiment enables others to assess the internal validity. Strategies to report include standardising (keeping conditions the same, e.g., all surgeries done by the same surgeon), randomising (e.g., the sampling or measurement order), and blocking or counterbalancing (e.g., position of animal cages or tanks on the rack), to ensure groups are similarly affected by a source of variability. In some cases, practical constraints prevent some nuisance variables from being randomised, but they can still be accounted for in the analysis (see Item 7. Statistical methods).\nReport the methods used to minimise confounding factors alongside the methods used to allocate animals to groups.

For example, animals of the same strain but from different sources, or animals obtained from the same source but at different times, may be genetically different1. The immune or microbiological status of the animals can also influence welfare, experimental variability, and scientific outcomes2–4.\nReport the health status of all animals used in the study and any previous procedures the animals have undergone. For example, if animals are specific pathogen free (SPF), list the pathogens that they were declared free of. If health status is unknown or was not tested, explicitly state this.\nFor genetically modified animals, describe the genetic modification status (e.g., knockout, overexpression), genotype (e.g., homozygous, heterozygous), manipulated gene(s), genetic methods and technologies used to generate the animals, how the genetic modification was confirmed, and details of animals used as controls (e.g., littermate controls5).\nReporting the correct nomenclature is crucial to understanding the data and ensuring that the research is discoverable and replicable6–8.

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nWithin a design, biological and technical factors will often be organised hierarchically, such as cells within animals and mitochondria within cells, or cages within rooms and animals within cages. Such hierarchies can make determining the sample size difficult (is it the number of animals, cells, or mitochondria?). The sample size is the number of experimental units per group. The experimental unit is defined as the biological entity subjected to an intervention independently of all other units, such that it is possible to assign any two experimental units to different treatment groups. It is also sometimes called the unit of randomisation. In addition, the experimental units should not influence each other on the outcomes that are measured.\nCommonly, the experimental unit is the individual animal, each independently allocated to a treatment group (e.g., a drug administered by injection). However, the experimental unit may be the cage or the litter (e.g., a diet administered to a whole cage, or a treatment administered to a dam and investigated in her pups), or it could be part of the animal (e.g., different drug treatments applied topically to distinct body regions of the same animal). Animals may also serve as their own controls, receiving different treatments separated by washout periods; here, the experimental unit is an animal for a period of time. There may also be multiple experimental units in a single experiment, such as when a treatment is given to a pregnant dam and then the weaned pups are allocated to different diets1. See2–4 for further guidance on identifying experimental units.\nConflating experimental units with subsamples or repeated measurements can lead to artificial inflation of the sample size. For example, measurements from 50 individual cells from a single mouse represent n = 1 when the experimental unit is the mouse. The 50 measurements are subsamples and provide an estimate of measurement error and so should be averaged or used in a nested analysis. Reporting n = 50 in this case is an example of pseudoreplication5. It underestimates the true variability in a study, which can lead to false positives and invalidate the analysis and resulting conclusions5,6. If, however, each cell taken from the mouse is then randomly allocated to different treatments and assessed individually, the cell might be regarded as the experimental unit.\nClearly indicate the experimental unit for each experiment so that the sample sizes and statistical analyses can be properly evaluated.",

Similarly, human clinical trials initiated based on insufficient or misleading animal research evidence increase research waste and negatively influence the risk-benefit balance for research participants1,2.\nConsider the type of study conducted to assess the implications of the findings.

Findings from a novel, exploratory study may be used to inform future research in a broadly similar context. Alternatively, enough evidence may have accumulated in the literature to justify further research in another species or in humans. Discuss what (if any) further research may be required to allow generalisation or translation. Discuss and interpret the results in relation to current evidence and, in particular, whether similar3 or otherwise supportive4 findings have been reported by other groups. Discuss the range of circumstances in which the effect is observed and factors that may moderate that effect. Such factors could include, for example, the population (e.g., age, sex, strain, species), the intervention (e.g., different drugs of the same class), and the outcome measured (e.g., different approaches to assessing memory).",

Different studies may be sensitive to different environmental factors, and particular aspects of the environment necessary to report may depend on the type of study2. Examples of housing and husbandry conditions known to affect animal welfare and research outcomes are listed in Table 1; consider reporting these elements and any other housing and husbandry conditions likely to influence the study outcomes.\nEnvironment, either deprived or enriched, can affect a wide range of physiological and behavioural responses3. Specific details to report include, but are not limited to, structural enrichment (e.g., elevated surfaces, dividers); resources for species-typical activities (e.g., nesting material, shelters, or gnawing sticks for rodents; plants or gravel for aquatic species); and toys or other tools used to stimulate exploration, exercise (e.g., running wheel), and novelty. If no environmental enrichment was provided, this should be clearly stated with justification. Similarly, scientific justification needs to be reported for withholding food and water4 and for singly housing animals5,6.\nIf space is an issue, relevant housing and husbandry details can be provided in the form of a link to the information in a public repository or as supplementary information.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Examples of information to consider when reporting housing and husbandry, and their effects on laboratory animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation to report\nExamples of effects on laboratory animals\n\n\n\n\nCage/tank/housing system (type and dimensions)\nAffects behaviour7 and fear learning8.

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nInclusion and exclusion criteria define the eligibility or disqualification of animals and data once the study has commenced. To ensure scientific rigour, the criteria should be defined before the experiment starts and data are collected1–4. Inclusion criteria should not be confused with animal characteristics (see Item 8. Experimental animals) but can be related to these (e.g., body weights must be within a certain range for a particular procedure) or related to other study parameters (e.g., task performance has to exceed a given threshold). In studies in which selected data are reanalysed for a different purpose, inclusion and exclusion criteria should describe how data were selected.\nExclusion criteria may result from technical or welfare issues such as complications anticipated during surgery or circumstances in which test procedures might be compromised (e.g., development of motor impairments that could affect behavioural measurements). Criteria for excluding samples or data include failure to meet quality control standards, such as insufficient sample volumes, unacceptable levels of contaminants, poor histological quality, etc. Similarly, how the researcher will define and handle data outliers during the analysis should also be decided before the experiment starts (see subitem 3b for guidance on responsible data cleaning).\nExclusion criteria may also reflect the ethical principles of a study in line with its humane endpoints (see Item 16. Animal care and monitoring). For example, in cancer studies, an animal might be dropped from the study and euthanised before the predetermined time point if the size of a subcutaneous tumour exceeds a specific volume5. If losses are anticipated, these should be considered when determining the number of animals to include in the study (see Item 2. Sample size). Whereas exclusion criteria and humane endpoints are typically included in the ethical review application, reporting the criteria used to exclude animals or data points in the manuscript helps readers with the interpretation of the data and provides crucial information to other researchers wanting to adopt the model.\nBest practice is to include all a priori inclusion and exclusion/outlier criteria in a preregistered protocol (see Item 19. Protocol registration). At the very least, these criteria should be documented in a laboratory notebook and reported in manuscripts, explicitly stating that the criteria were defined before any data was collected.",

    "text": "Explanation\nAkin to the approach taken for clinical trials, protocol registration has emerged as a mechanism that is likely to improve the transparency of animal research1–3. Registering a protocol before the start of the experiment enables researchers to demonstrate that the hypothesis, approach, and analysis were planned in advance and not shaped by data as they emerged; it enhances scientific rigour and protects the researcher against concerns about selective reporting of results4,5. A protocol should consist of (1) the question being addressed and the key features of the research that is proposed, such as the hypothesis being tested, the primary outcome measure (if applicable), and the statistical analysis plan; and (2) the laboratory procedures to be used to perform the planned experiment.\nProtocols may be registered with different levels of completeness. For example, in the Registered Report format offered by an increasing number of journals, protocols undergo peer review, and if accepted, the journal commits to publishing the completed research regardless of the results obtained2.\nOther online resources include the Open Science Framework6, which is suitable to deposit PHISPS (Population; Hypothesis; Intervention; Statistical Analysis Plan; Primary; Outcome Measure; Sample Size Calculation) protocols7 and provide researchers with the flexibility to embargo the preregistration, keep it from public view until the research is published, and selectively share it with reviewers and editors. The EDA can also be used to generate a time-stamped PDF, which sets out key elements of the experimental design8. This can be used to demonstrate that the study conduct, analysis, and reporting were not unduly driven by emerging data. As a minimum, we recommend registering protocols containing all PHISPS components as outlined above.\nProvide a statement indicating whether or not any protocol was prepared before the study, and if applicable, provide the time-stamped protocol or the location of its registration. When there have been deviations from the protocol, describe the rationale for these changes in the publication so that readers can take this into account when assessing the findings.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIn hypothesis-testing studies using inferential statistics, investigators frequently confuse statistical significance and small p-values with biological or clinical importance1. Statistical significance is usually quantified and evaluated against a preassigned threshold, with p &lt; 0.05 often used as a convention. However, statistical significance is heavily influenced by sample size and variation in the data (see Item 2. Sample size). Investigators must consider the size of the effect that was observed and whether this is a biologically relevant change.\nEffect sizes are often not reported in animal research, but they are relevant to both exploratory and hypothesis-testing studies. An effect size is a quantitative measure that estimates the magnitude of differences between groups or strength of relationships between variables. It can be used to assess the patterns in the data collected and make inferences about the wider population from which the sample came. The confidence interval for the effect indicates how precisely the effect has been estimated and tells the reader about the strength of the effect2. In studies in which statistical power is low and/or hypothesis-testing is inappropriate, providing the effect size and confidence interval indicates how small or large an effect might really be, so a reader can judge the biological significance of the data3,4. Reporting effect sizes with confidence intervals also facilitates extraction of useful data for systematic review and meta-analysis. When multiple independent studies included in a meta-analysis show quantitatively similar effects, even if each is statistically nonsignificant, this provides powerful evidence that a relationship is ‘real’, although small.\nReport all analyses performed, even those providing non-statistically significant results. Report the effect size to indicate the size of the difference between groups in the study, with a confidence interval to indicate the precision of the effect size estimate.\nExample\n\n\n\nExample of reporting this item.

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nFor any type of experiment, it is crucial to explain how the sample size was determined. For hypothesis-testing experiments, in which inferential statistics are used to estimate the size of the effect and to determine the weight of evidence against the null hypothesis, the sample size needs to be justified to ensure experiments are of an optimal size to test the research question1,2 (see Item 13. Objectives). Sample sizes that are too small (i.e., underpowered studies) produce inconclusive results, whereas sample sizes that are too large (i.e., overpowered studies) raise ethical issues over unnecessary use of animals and may produce trivial findings that are statistically significant but not biologically relevant3. Low power has three effects: first, within the experiment, real effects are more likely to be missed; second, when an effect is detected, this will often be an overestimation of the true effect size4; and finally, when low power is combined with publication bias, there is an increase in the false positive rate in the published literature5. Consequently, low-powered studies contribute to the poor internal validity of research and risk wasting animals used in inconclusive research6.\nStudy design can influence the statistical power of an experiment, and the power calculation used needs to be appropriate for the design implemented. Statistical programmes to help perform a priori sample size calculations exist for a variety of experimental designs and statistical analyses, both freeware (web-based applets and functions in R) and commercial software7–8. Choosing the appropriate calculator or algorithm to use depends on the type of outcome measures and independent variables, and the number of groups. Consultation with a statistician is recommended, especially when the experimental design is complex or unusual.\nWhen the experiment tests the effect of an intervention on the mean of a continuous outcome measure, the sample size can be calculated a priori, based on a mathematical relationship between the predefined, biologically relevant effect size, variability estimated from prior data, chosen significance level, power, and sample size (see Section 3 and9,10 for practical advice). If you have used an a priori sample size calculation, report\n\nthe analysis method (e.g., two-tailed Student t test with a 0.05 significance threshold)\nthe effect size of interest and a justification explaining why an effect size of that magnitude is relevant\nthe estimate of variability used (e.g., standard deviation) and how it was estimated\nthe power selected.",

    "section": "Information used in a power calculation",
    "text": "Information used in a power calculation\nSample size calculation is based on a mathematical relationship between the following parameters: effect size, variability, significance level, power, and sample size. Questions to consider are the following:\n\nThe primary objective of the experiment—What is the main outcome measure?\nThe primary outcome measure should be identified in the planning stage of the experiment; it is the outcome of greatest importance, which will answer the main experimental question.\n\n\nThe predefined effect size—What is a biologically relevant effect size?\nThe effect size is estimated as a biologically relevant change in the primary outcome measure between the groups under study. This can be informed by similar studies and involves scientists exploring what magnitude of effect would generate interest and would be worth taking forward into further work. In preclinical studies, the clinical relevance of the effect should also be taken into consideration.\n\n\nWhat is the estimate of variability?\nEstimates of variability can be obtained\n\nFrom data collected from a preliminary experiment conducted under identical conditions to the planned experiment, e.g., a previous experiment in the same laboratory, testing the same treatment under similar conditions on animals with the same characteristics\nFrom the control group in a previous experiment testing a different treatment\nFrom a similar experiment reported in the literature\n\n\n\nSignificance threshold—What risk of a false positive is acceptable?\nThe significance level or threshold (α) is the probability of obtaining a false positive. If it is set at 0.05, then the risk of obtaining a false positive is 1 in 20 for a single statistical test. However, the threshold or the p-values will need to be adjusted in scenarios of multiple testing (e.g., by using a Bonferroni correction).\n\n\nPower—What risk of a false negative is acceptable?\nFor a predefined, biologically meaningful effect size, the power (1 − β) is the probability that the statistical test will detect the effect if it genuinely exists (i.e., true positive result). A target power between 80% and 95% is normally deemed acceptable, which entails a risk of false negative between 5% and 20%.\n\n\nDirectionality—Will you use a one- or two-sided test?\nThe directionality of a test depends on the distribution of the test statistics for a given analysis. For tests based on t or z distributions (such as t tests), whether the data will be analysed using a one- or two-sided test relates to whether the alternative hypothesis is directional or not. An experiment with a directional (one-sided) alternative hypothesis can be powered and analysed with a one-sided test with the goal of maximising the sensitivity to detect this directional effect. Controversy exists within the statistics community on when it is appropriate to use a one-sided test11. The use of a one-sided test requires justification of why a treatment effect is only of interest when it is in a defined direction and why they would treat a large effect in the unexpected direction no differently from a nonsignificant difference12. Following the use of a one-sided test, the investigator cannot then test for the possibility of missing an effect in the untested direction. Choosing a one-tailed test for the sole purpose of attaining statistical significance is not appropriate.\nTwo-sided tests with a nondirectional alternative hypothesis are much more common and allow researchers to detect the effect of a treatment regardless of its direction.\nNote that analyses such as ANOVA and chi-squared are based on asymmetrical distributions (F-distribution and chi-squared distribution) with only one tail. Therefore, these tests do not have a directionality option.\nThere are several types of studies in which a priori sample size calculations are not appropriate. For example, the number of animals needed for antibody or tissue production is determined by the amount required and the production ability of an individual animal. For studies in which the outcome is the successful generation of a sample or a condition (e.g., the production of transgenic animals), the number of animals is determined by the probability of success of the experimental procedure.\nIn early feasibility or pilot studies, the number of animals required depends on the purpose of the study. When the objective of the preliminary study is primarily logistic or operational (e.g., to improve procedures and equipment), the number of animals needed is generally small. In such cases, power calculations are not appropriate and sample sizes can be estimated based on operational capacity and constraints13. Pilot studies alone are unlikely to provide adequate data on variability for a power calculation for future experiments. Systematic reviews and previous studies are more appropriate sources of information on variability14.\nIf no power calculation was used to determine the sample size, state this explicitly and provide the reasoning that was used to decide on the sample size per group. Regardless of whether a power calculation was used or not, when explaining how the sample size was determined take into consideration any anticipated loss of animals or data, for example, due to exclusion criteria established upfront or expected attrition (see Item 3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria).",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe statistical analysis methods implemented will reflect the goals and the design of the experiment; they should be decided in advance before data are collected (see Item 19. Protocol registration). Both exploratory and hypothesis-testing studies might use descriptive statistics to summarise the data (e.g., mean and SD, or median and range). In exploratory studies in which no specific hypothesis was tested, reporting descriptive statistics is important for generating new hypotheses that may be tested in subsequent experiments, but it does not allow conclusions beyond the data. In addition to descriptive statistics, hypothesis-testing studies might use inferential statistics to test a specific hypothesis.\nReporting the analysis methods in detail is essential to ensure readers and peer reviewers can assess the appropriateness of the methods selected and judge the validity of the output. The description of the statistical analysis should provide enough detail so that another researcher could reanalyse the raw data using the same method and obtain the same results. Make it clear which method was used for which analysis.\nAnalysing the data using different methods and selectively reporting those with statistically significant results constitutes p-hacking and introduces bias in the literature1,2. Report all analyses performed in full. Relevant information to describe the statistical methods include\n\nthe outcome measures\nthe independent variables of interest\nthe nuisance variables taken into account in each statistical test (e.g., as blocking factors or covariates)\nwhat statistical analyses were performed and references for the methods used\nhow missing values were handled\nadjustment for multiple comparisons\nthe software package and version used, including computer code if available3\n\nThe outcome measure is potentially affected by the treatments or interventions being tested but also by other factors, such as the properties of the biological samples (sex, litter, age, weight, etc.) and technical considerations (cage, time of day, batch, experimenter, etc.). To reduce the risk of bias, some of these factors can be taken into account in the design of the experiment, for example, by using blocking factors in the randomisation (see Item 4. Randomisation). Factors deemed to affect the variability of the outcome measure should also be handled in the analysis, for example, as a blocking factor (e.g., batch of reagent or experimenter) or as a covariate (e.g., starting tumour size at point of randomisation).\nFurthermore, to conduct the analysis appropriately, it is important to recognise the hierarchy that can exist in an experiment. The hierarchy can induce a clustering effect; for example, cage, litter, or animal effects can occur when the outcomes measured for animals from the same cage/litter, or for cells from the same animal, are more similar to each other. This relationship has to be managed in the statistical analysis by including cage/litter/animal effects in the model or by aggregating the outcome measure to the cage/litter/animal level. Thus, describing the reality of the experiment and the hierarchy of the data, along with the measures taken in the design and the analysis to account for this hierarchy, is crucial to assessing whether the statistical methods used are appropriate.\nFor bespoke analysis—for example, regression analysis with many terms—it is essential to describe the analysis pipeline in detail. This could include detailing the starting model and any model simplification steps.\nWhen reporting descriptive statistics, explicitly state which measure of central tendency is reported (e.g., mean or median) and which measure of variability is reported (e.g., standard deviation, range, quartiles, or interquartile range). Also describe any modification made to the raw data before analysis (e.g., relative quantification of gene expression against a housekeeping gene). For further guidance on statistical reporting, refer to the Statistical Analyses and Methods in the Published Literature (SAMPL) guidelines4.",

    "text": "Examples\n\n‘Analysis of variance was performed using the GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Inst., Cary, NC). Average pen values were used as the experimental unit for the performance parameters. The model considered the effects of block and dietary treatment (5 diets). Data were adjusted by the covariant of initial body weight. Orthogonal contrasts were used to test the effects of SDPP processing (UV vs no UV) and dietary SDPP level (3% vs 6%). Results are presented as least squares means. The level of significance was set at P &lt; 0.05’5.\n\n\n‘All risk factors of interest were investigated in a single model. Logistic regression allows blocking factors and explicitly investigates the effect of each independent variable controlling for the effects of all others…. As we were interested in husbandry and environmental effects, we blocked the analysis by important biological variables (age; backstrain; inbreeding; sex; breeding status) to control for their effect. (The role of these biological variables in barbering behavior, particularly with reference to barbering as a model for the human disorder trichotillomania, is described elsewhere …). We also blocked by room to control for the effect of unknown environmental variables associated with this design variable. We tested for the effect of the following husbandry and environmental risk factors: cage mate relationships (i.e. siblings, non-siblings, or mixed); cage type (i.e. plastic or steel); cage height from floor; cage horizontal position (whether the cage was on the side or the middle of a rack); stocking density; and the number of adults in the cage. Cage material by cage height from floor; and cage material by cage horizontal position interactions were examined, and then removed from the model as they were nonsignificant. N = 1959 mice were included in this analysis’6.",

    "text": "Examples\n\n11a—Strengths and limitations of the management of this case\n\n“The data which we have presented here have been limited by the restrictions of clinical practice, and in the appendix, we have outlined the major shortcomings of the pharmacokinetic calculations we have made. However, despite the difficulties in deriving accurate estimates of the true apparent volumes of distribution involved, the changes we have observed are too large merely to be accounted for by pharmacokinetic inaccuracies; indeed, any overestimation of the true volumes strengthens the argument. We believe that the changes we have observed are real and have contributed to the digoxin toxicity which occurred in these patients. Further characterization of the cause of the abnormal distribution of digoxin in renal failure by more precise prospective clinical studies is required.”\n\nFrom Altered distribution of digoxin in renal failure—a case of digoxin toxicity?4\n\n\n11b—Relevant medical literature\n\n“Dr Barnard successfully used a hypothermic perfusion system to protect a donor heart for more than 16 hours in heterotopic HTx5. However, surgeons are more conservative while performing orthotopic HTx. Few series are using donor hearts with IT longer than 6 hours. Long-term follow-up of HTx recipients at Columbia University in New York and Alfred Hospital in Australia has demonstrated that prolonged IT (average 5 hours) did not adversely affect immediate or long-term survival or the incidence of transplant coronary artery disease6,7. The University of Western Ontario in Canada and The University of Alabama at Birmingham have also demonstrated that long-term survival of HTx was not affected by prolonged IT (longest times 457 minutes and 479 minutes, respectively)8,9.”\n\nFrom Successful heart transplantation after 13 hours of donor heart ischemia with the use of HTK solution: a case report10.\n\n\n11c—Rationale for conclusions (including assessment of cause and effect)\n\n“The actual incidence of statin-exacerbated myasthenia is unknown, and only a handful of reports of statin-associated myasthenia gravis have ever been described. Out of six published case reports, only five patients were noted to have some degree of recovery and only one patient had a complete recovery upon termination of statin therapy.\nHow statins could appear to exacerbate MG is unclear. It is possible that the mechanism actually reflects a ‘double hit’ phenomenon of defective neuromuscular transmission secondary to antibody-mediated postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor dysfunction in combination with a statin-induced myopathy.\nThe clear development of a statin myopathy with simvastatin treatment before the onset of myasthenia in our patient is consistent with the possibility of a second (atorvastatin-induced) myopathy coalescing with the onset of myasthenia gravis. The symptomatic improvement that followed his withdrawal from atorvastatin treatment resulted from the resolution of this statin myopathy.\nWe also considered other potential causes of deterioration such as sepsis, steroid-induced worsening of MG, steroid myopathy, and cholinergic crisis, but we considered their development less likely based on clinical grounds.\nWe cannot rule out completely the possibility that the worsening of our patient’s MG simply reflected a progression of his MG. However, the clinical course of his condition, as well as the statin-induced proximal limb pain and weakness (without bulbar features) he experienced before his presentation, raises at the very least the possibility that a component of his initial deterioration was statin related.\nSimilarly, we note that his improvement could have reflected the immunosuppressive effects of therapy for his MG rather than the withdrawal of his atorvastatin treatment. It seems probable, however, that both factors played a significant role in the improvement of his clinical state.\nThe development of other autoimmune disorders such as dermatomyositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis, and Lupus-like syndrome upon initiation of statin therapy raises the possibility that in predisposed individuals, statins may precipitate an immunological trigger that is analogous to penicillamine-induced MG although clearly different in temporal respect. However, given the paucity of reports and the widespread use of statins, the possibility of chance association cannot be excluded still.”\n\nFrom Statin-associated weakness in myasthenia gravis: a case report11.\n\n\n11d—Main “take-away” lessons of this case report\n\n“This infant met the diagnostic criteria of the Medical Task Force on Anencephaly. Therefore, she was the longest surviving anencephalic infant who did not require any life-sustaining treatments such as intubation or feeding tubes. Knowing this rare possibility, the physician and family should make goal-oriented decisions on how to care for the infant. The provider should offer immunizations and well childcare to each family if the infant survives the immediate newborn period. This case should affect the practice of physicians who interact with expectant mothers of a child affected by anencephaly.”\n\nFrom Prolonged unassisted survival in an infant with anencephaly12.",

Primary Outcome: At 1 month after the intervention, the percentage of responders (Low Back Pain intensity &lt;40) was higher in the glucocorticoid intradiscal injection (GCIDI) group (36 of 65 [55.4%]) than the control group (21of 63 [33.3%]) (absolute risk difference, 22.1 percent-age points [CI, 5.5 to 38.7 percentage points]; P=0.009 [after multiple imputation]) . . . In the sensitivity analysis, the mean reduction in LBP [low back pain] intensity from baseline to 1 month was greater in the GCIDI group (−32.5 [CI,-38.2 to −26.8]) than the control group (−17.5 [CI, −23.3 to −11.7]) (absolute difference, -15.0 [CI,-22.9 to −7.1]; P&lt; 0.001).”1\n“Owing to the later inclusion of parent cosmetic appearance assessments (to assist with trial conduct), it was decided to perform a post hoc subgroup analysis to determine whether the scores given by the assessors and parents differed between treatment groups [Table 1] . . . The assessor scores did not indicate a difference between the nail-replaced and nail-discarded groups.

    "text": "Explanation\nMultiple analyses of the same data create a risk for false-positive findings.3 Authors should especially resist the temptation to perform many subgroup analyses.4–6 Analyses that were prespecified in the trial protocol (item 3) are much more reliable than those suggested by the data, and therefore authors should report which analyses were prespecified. If subgroup analyses were undertaken, authors should report which subgroups were examined, why, whether they were prespecified, and how many were prespecified. Selective reporting of subgroup analyses could lead to bias.7 When evaluating a subgroup, the question is not whether the subgroup demonstrates a statistically significant result but whether the subgroup treatment effects are significantly different from each other. To determine this, a test of interaction is helpful, although the power for such tests is typically low. If formal evaluations of interaction are undertaken (item 21d) they should be reported as the estimated difference in the intervention effect in each subgroup (with a CI), not just as P values.\nIn one survey,4 35 of 50 trial reports included subgroup analyses, of which only 42% used tests of interaction. It was often difficult to determine whether subgroup analyses had been specified in the protocol. In another survey of surgical trials published in high impact journals, 27 of 72 trials reported 54 subgroup analyses of which 91% were post hoc and only 6% of subgroup analyses used a test of interaction to assess whether a subgroup effect existed.8",

    "text": "Explanation\nAlthough the eligibility criteria (item 12a) indicate who was eligible for the trial, it is also important to know the characteristics of the participants who were actually included. This information allows readers, especially clinicians, to judge how relevant the results of a trial might be to an individual patient. Participant baseline demographics may include characteristics such as age, sex and/or gender,2 place of residence, race and/or ethnicity, culture and/or religion, language, occupation, education, or socioeconomic status. Baseline clinical characteristics include those which are identical, or closely related, to the trial outcomes.3\nRandomised trials aim to compare groups of participants that differ only with respect to the intervention (treatment). Although proper random assignment prevents selection bias, it does not guarantee similarity of the groups at baseline. Any differences in baseline characteristics are, however, the result of chance rather than bias.4 Important demographic and clinical characteristics should be presented so that readers can assess how similar the groups were at baseline. Baseline data are especially valuable for outcomes that can also be measured at the start of the trial (eg, blood pressure).\nBaseline information is most efficiently presented in a table. For continuous variables, such as weight or blood pressure, the variability of the data should be reported, along with average values. Continuous variables can be summarised for each group by the mean and standard deviation. When continuous data have an asymmetrical distribution, a preferable approach may be to quote the median and percentile values (eg, the 25th and 75th percentiles).5 Standard errors and CIs are not appropriate for describing variability—they are inferential rather than descriptive statistics. Variables with a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be treated as continuous variables; instead, numbers and proportions should be reported for each category.5,6\nSignificance testing of baseline differences is not recommended and should not be reported.4,7,8 Such significance tests assess the probability that observed baseline differences could have occurred by chance; however, providing the randomisation has not been subverted or comprised, any differences are caused by chance. Unfortunately, such significance tests are still relatively common.9–11 Such hypothesis testing is superfluous and can mislead investigators and their readers.12 Rather, comparisons at baseline should be based on consideration of the prognostic strength of the variables measured and the magnitude of any chance imbalances that have occurred.12",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe term “blinding” (masking) refers to withholding information about the assigned interventions from people involved in the trial who may potentially be influenced by this knowledge. Blinding is an important safeguard against bias, particularly when assessing subjective outcomes.5\nBenjamin Franklin has been credited as being the first to use blinding in a scientific experiment.6 He blindfolded participants so they would not know when he was applying mesmerism (a popular healing technique of the 18th century) and in so doing demonstrated that mesmerism was a sham. Since then, the scientific community has widely recognised the power of blinding to reduce bias, and it has remained a commonly used strategy in scientific experiments.\nThe section on blinding terminology below defines the groups of individuals (ie, participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, outcome assessors, and data analysts) that can potentially introduce bias into a trial through knowledge of the treatment assignments. Participants may respond differently if they are aware of their treatment assignment (eg, respond more favourably when they receive the new treatment).5 Lack of blinding may also influence adherence with the intervention, use of co-interventions, and risk of dropping out of the trial.\n\nBlinding terminology\nFor a technical term to be useful, its use and interpretation must be consistent. Authors of trials commonly use the term “double blind,” and less commonly the terms “single blind” or “triple blind.” A problem with this lexicon is that there is great variability in clinician interpretations and epidemiological textbook definitions of these terms.7 Moreover, a study of 200 randomised trials reported as double blind demonstrated 18 different combinations of groups actually blinded when the authors of these trials were surveyed, and approximately one in every five of these trials—reported as double blind—did not blind participants, healthcare providers, or data collectors.8\nThis research demonstrates that terms are ambiguous and, as such, authors and editors should abandon their usage in isolation without defining them. Authors should instead explicitly report the blinding status of the people involved for whom blinding may influence the validity of a trial.\nThe healthcare providers include all personnel (eg, physicians, chiropractors, physiotherapists, nurses) who care for the participants during the trial. Data collectors are the individuals who collect data on the trial outcomes. Outcome assessors are the individuals who determine whether a participant did experience the outcomes of interest.\nSome researchers have also advocated blinding and reporting the blinding status of the data monitoring committee and the manuscript writers.9 Blinding of these groups is uncommon and the value of blinding them is debated.10\nSometimes one group of individuals (eg, the healthcare providers) is also the same individuals fulfilling another role in a trial (eg, the data collectors). Even if this is the case, the authors should state the blinding status of these groups to allow readers to judge the validity of the trial.\nUnblinded healthcare providers may introduce similar biases; and unblinded data collectors may differentially assess outcomes (eg, frequency or timing), repeat measurements of abnormal findings, or provide encouragement during performance testing. Unblinded outcome assessors may differentially assess subjective outcomes, and unblinded data analysts may introduce bias through the choice of analytical strategies, such as the selection of favourable time points or outcomes and by decisions to remove patients from the analyses. These biases have been well documented.5,9,11–1314\nBlinding, unlike allocation concealment (item 18), may not always be appropriate or possible. In pragmatic trials (trials that try to make the experience as close as real life so as to understand real world effectiveness), blinding of participants and healthcare providers would decrease the pragmatism of the trials, since patients in real life are not blinded.15 An example where blinding is impossible is a trial comparing levels of pain associated with sampling blood from the ear or thumb.16 However, in randomised trials for which blinding is possible, lack of blinding has usually been associated with empirical evidence of exaggeration in treatment effect estimates.175,18–22 Blinding is particularly important when outcome measures involve some subjectivity, such as assessment of pain. Yet, blinding may not be as important in certain fields or with certain outcomes. For example, blinding of data collectors and outcome assessors is unlikely to matter for objective outcomes, such as death from any cause. Indeed, some methodological investigations have not found that lack of blinding is associated with empirical evidence of bias in treatment effect estimates.2324–29 Even then, however, lack of participant or healthcare provider blinding can lead to other problems, such as differential attrition.30 In certain trials, especially surgical trials, blinding of participants and healthcare providers is often difficult or impossible, but blinding of data collectors and outcome assessors for both benefits and harms is often achievable and recommended. For example, lesions can be photographed before and after treatment and assessed by an external observer.31 Regardless of whether blinding is possible, authors can and should always state who was blinded (ie, participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, data analysts, and/or outcome assessors).32,33\nHowever, authors frequently do not report whether blinding was used.34,35 For example, reports of 51% of 506 trials in cystic fibrosis,36 33% of 196 trials in rheumatoid arthritis,37 and 38% of 68 trials in dermatology38 did not state whether blinding was used. Similarly, a more recent review found that the reports of 38% of 622 trials in ﻿high impact anaesthesiology journals did not explicitly describe the trial as blinded or non-blinded.39 Moreover, when describing some form of blinding, the most used term was the ambiguous “double blind.”39 Authors should explicitly state who was blinded, but only 14% of 622 trials explicitly reported whether the three key groups of individuals—that is, the participants, healthcare providers, and data collectors—were blinded or not.39 The rate did improve from 10% to 26% over the years of that review, but more improvement is needed. Until authors of trials improve their reporting of blinding, readers will have difficulty in judging its adequacy.\nThe term “masking” is sometimes used in preference to “blinding” to avoid confusion with the medical condition of being without sight. However, “blinding” in its methodological sense appears to be more universally understood worldwide and to be generally preferred for reporting clinical trials.30,31,40",

    "text": "Explanation\nDisclosure of authors’ conflicts of interest provides important context for readers of a trial report when ascertaining the overall methodological rigor of a trial (eg, relevance of the type of comparator intervention and eligibility criteria for patients) and risk of bias (eg, selective reporting of favourable results). Conflicts of interest of all trial manuscript authors should be reported, along with any procedures to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest influencing the trial’s design, conduct, analysis, or reporting.\nConflicts of interest can be defined as “a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest.”2 In the context of authors of a trial report, conflicts of interest imply a risk that investigators’ personal interests and allegiances, or ties with companies or organisations, have undue influence on the design, conduct, analysis, or reporting of a trial. The concept implies a risk of influence and is not indicative of actual wrongdoing.\nConflicts of interest are most often associated with the drug and device industries. Types of financial ties include salary support or grants; ownership of stock or options; honorariums (eg, for advice, authorship, or public speaking); paid consultancy or service on advisory boards and medical education companies; and receipt of patents or patents pending. An analysis of 200 trials from 2015 reported that 57% of trials had at least one author declaring financial conflicts of interests.3\nConflicts of interest may also exist with support from or affiliation with government agencies, charities, and professional and civic organisations. Non-financial conflicts of interest include academic commitments; personal or professional relationships; and political, religious, or other affiliations with special interests or advocacy positions. An analysis of 200 trials found that 4% of trials had at least one author declaring non-financial conflicts of interest.3 There is ongoing discussion on the association between a problematic non-financial conflict of interest and a reasonable point of view.4\nA cross sectional study of 190 randomised trials, published in core clinical journals, found that trials with authors’ conflicts of interest had more positive results than trials without. The presence of a financial tie was associated with a positive study outcome (odds ratio 3.23; 95% CI 1.7 to 6.1). This association was also present after adjustment for the study funding source (odds ratio 3.57; 95% CI 1.7 to 7.7).5\nAlthough financial conflicts of interest are often declared in trials,3 the declarations are generally imprecise, and undisclosed conflicts are common.6 A systematic review of studies comparing financial conflicts of interest declared in medical publications or guidelines (not only randomised trials) with declarations in payment databases (eg, the Open Payments Database) found that the median percentage of authors with “non-concordant” disclosures was 81%.6 A study including only randomised trials found that 35 (30%) of 115 authors from non-industry funded trials had undisclosed conflicts of interest whereas that was the case for 102 (50%) of 203 authors from industry funded trials.7 For financial conflicts that cannot be tracked to public databases and for non-financial conflicts, the rate of non-disclosure is unknown but it is likely to be even higher.",

    "text": "Explanation\nA comprehensive description of the eligibility criteria used to select the trial participants is needed to help readers interpret the study. In particular, all inclusion and exclusion criteria should be reported to judge to whom the results of a trial apply—that is, the trial’s generalisability (applicability) and relevance to clinical or public health practice (item 30).2 A description of the method of recruitment, such as by referral or self-selection (eg, through advertisements) is also important in this context. Because they are applied before randomisation, eligibility criteria do not affect the internal validity of a trial, but they are central to its external validity.\nTypical and widely accepted selection criteria relate to the nature and stage of the condition or disease being studied, the exclusion of persons thought to be particularly vulnerable to harm from the study intervention, and to issues required to ensure that the study satisfies legal and ethical norms. The informed consent of study participants, for example, is typically required in intervention studies. Where relevant, it is important to describe whether sex and/or gender were taken into account in the design of the trial, including whether there was adequate representation of men and women (or diverse genders), and justify the reasons for any exclusion.3\nDespite their importance, eligibility criteria are often not reported adequately. For example, in an analysis of 283 reports of trials published between 1994 and 2006 in high impact general medical journals, reporting of exclusion criteria was often poor and incomplete: 84% of published trials contained at least one poorly justified exclusion criteria, and in 61% more than a quarter of the trial’s exclusion criteria were poorly justified.4 Any differences in eligibility criteria between the trial protocol and final publication should also be highlighted and reasons for any discrepancies reported. A review of 52 protocols and 75 subsequent full publications submitted to a German medical ethics committee between 2000 and 2006 identified modifications to the eligibility criteria for 85% of trial publications, with 41% of final publications containing newly added criteria.5 Similar deficiencies have been found in other studies.6,7",

    "text": "Explanation\nReporting the funding source(s), and the exact roles of the trial funders, provides important context for readers of a trial report when ascertaining overall methodological rigor (eg, relevance of the type of comparator intervention and eligibility criteria for patients) and risk of bias (eg, selective reporting of favourable results). The trial report should therefore describe details of all funders and the types of funding, as well as the role of the funder in trial design (ie, protocol development), conduct, data analysis, and reporting (ie, interpretation, manuscript writing, and dissemination of results). This should include whether the funder controlled the final decision regarding any of these aspects of the trial, and any mechanisms introduced to minimise funder influence. If the funder had no direct involvement in the trial, that should be stated.\nA randomised trial requires considerable funding, typically from pharmaceutical or device companies (industry funding); or from research councils or other scientific or private foundations, or governmental or non-governmental organisations (non-industry funding).3 One study of trials conducted between 2010 and 2015 estimated the median cost per phase 3 drug company trial at $21.4m (£17.21m; €20.7m),4 with substantial variation. The mean cost of clinical trials funded by the NIHR in the UK, reflecting differences in the research and care infrastructure already funded, was lower, but still sizeable—approximately £1.3m—with considerable variation.5 The various types of funders differ in their overall agenda, their reasons for funding a trial, and their propensity to influence the trial.\nFunding of a trial typically involves direct monetary support, but financial support may also be provided indirectly in the form of free trial drugs, equipment, or services (eg, statistical analysis or use of medical writers).6 Among the most highly cited clinical trials published in 2019 to 2022, two thirds were funded by industry sponsors, many of whom also provided industry analysts and coauthors.7\nIndustry funding of trials is associated with conclusions that favour the experimental intervention. A systematic review of 75 methodological studies, comparing industry funded studies with non-industry funded studies (mostly randomised trials), reported that industry funded studies had favourable conclusions more often than non‐industry funded studies (risk ratio 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.51).8 Industry funded trials may also report more favourable results (ie, larger estimates of intervention effects) than comparable trials that are funded by non-industry sources. One review of eight published meta-epidemiological studies reported that intervention effects (odds ratios) from industry funded trials were, on average, exaggerated by 5% (95% CI −6% to 15%), although the result was imprecise and consistent with chance findings. However, trials with a high risk of industry funder influence (eg, on trial design, conduct, analysis, and reporting) exaggerated effect estimates by 12% (95% CI 3% to 19%).9 Undue influence on trials from non-industry funders with a strong interest in a specific trial result has been described,10 but has been studied much less.\nA review of 200 trials published in 201511 found that 178 (89%) publications included a funding statement. However, in half of the publications, the role of funder was not reported; in the other half, the reporting was often unclear or incomplete; and undisclosed funding from a for-profit organisation was found in 26 of 54 trials reporting only not-for-profit funding. Another study surveyed authors of 200 trials fully funded by industry and found that funders had been involved in the design of 173 trials (87%), in the data analysis of 146 trials (73%), and in the reporting of 173 trials (87%).6 No clear consensus exists on a monetary threshold for when funding from a source with conflict of interest becomes problematic. It is also unclear whether commercial funding is less important than the degree and type of funder influence on trial design, conduct, analysis, and reporting.",

    "text": "Explanation\nAs noted in item 18, concealment of the allocated intervention at the time of enrolment is especially important. Thus, in addition to knowing the methods used, it is also important to understand how the random sequence was implemented; specifically, whether the personnel who enrolled and those who assigned participants to the interventions had access to the random allocation sequence.\nIn practice, the process of randomising participants into a trial has three different steps: sequence generation, allocation concealment mechanism, and implementation (see Table 1). Although the same individuals may carry out more than one process under each heading, investigators should strive for complete separation of the people involved with generation and allocation concealment from the people who implement assignments. Thus, if someone is involved in the sequence generation or allocation concealment steps, ideally, they should not be involved in the implementation step. When this separation is not possible, importantly the investigators should ensure that the assignment schedule is unpredictable and locked away from even the person who generated it.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Steps in a typical randomisation process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence generation\nAllocation concealment\nImplementation\n\n\n\n\nGenerate allocation sequence by a random procedure\n\n\nDevelop allocation concealment mechanism (eg, numbered, identical bottles or sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes)\nEnrol participants:\n• assess eligibility\n• discuss the trial\n• obtain informed consent\n• enrol participant in trial\n\n\n\nPrepare the allocation concealment mechanism using the allocation sequence from the sequence generation step\n\nAscertain intervention assignment\n(eg, opening next envelope) and assign participant to appropriate intervention\n\n\n\n\nAdminister intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with flawless sequence generation and allocation concealment, failure to separate creation and concealment of the allocation sequence from assignment to trial group may introduce bias. For example, the person who was enrolling and assigning participants and who also generated an allocation sequence would likely have access to the sequence list and could consult it when interviewing potential participants for a trial. Thus, that person could bias the enrolment or assignment process, regardless of the unpredictability of the assignment sequence and the impenetrability of the allocation concealment mechanism. Investigators must therefore ensure that the assignment schedule is unpredictable and locked away (eg, in a safe deposit box in a building inaccessible to the enrolment location) from even the person who generated it. In that instance, the report of the trial should specify where the investigators stored the allocation list.\nThus, for full assessment of randomisation in a trial report, authors should confirm that personnel who enrolled and those who assigned participants to the interventions did not have access to the random allocation sequence. At minimum, authors should confirm complete separation of the people involved with generation and allocation concealment from the people involved in the implementation of assignments. If complete separation did not occur, then authors should describe how the people involved in the implementation were prevented from accessing the sequence (eg, specifying that the allocation sequence was locked in a secure location).\nSometimes those who enrol and those who assign are different people, but frequently the same individuals do both. These individuals may be termed differently by authors (eg, recruiters), but the functions remain the same.\nFull assessment of implementation is not always possible from trial reports. In a sample of 199 medical journals, 63% of trial reports did not provide sufficient information to assess whether the person who generated the allocation sequence was not also the person who allocated participants to treatment groups.6 Only 31% of trial reports provided sufficient details ﻿on who recruited participants and who generated the allocation sequence.6",

Several studies have shown poor reporting of interventions and comparators in randomised trials.3–89–12 Authors should describe each intervention thoroughly, including control interventions, or use of placebo procedure.13,14 The description should provide sufficient detail to allow replication, such as to allow a clinician wanting to use the intervention to know exactly how to administer the intervention/comparator that was evaluated in the trial.4 Key information includes the different components of the intervention/comparator, how and when it should be administered, the intervention/comparator material (ie, any physical or informational materials used in the intervention/comparator, including those provided to participants or used in intervention/comparator delivery or in training of providers and where it can be accessed (eg, online appendix, URL)); the procedure for tailoring the intervention/comparator to individual participants, and how fidelity15 (ie, the extent to which the intervention/comparator were implemented as planned in the protocol by care providers) or adherence15 (ie, the extent to which trial participants implement the intervention/comparator as planned in the protocol) were assessed or enhanced (see below for more examples).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of essential information to be reported for various types of interventions in randomised trials16,17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrug17\n\nGeneric name\nManufacturer\nDose\nRoute of administration (eg, oral, intravenous)\nTiming\nTitration regimen if applicable\nDuration of administration\nProcedure for tailoring the intervention to individual participants\nConditions under which interventions are withheld\nWhether and how adherence of patients to the intervention was assessed or enhanced\nAny physical or informational materials used in the intervention and where the materials can be accessed.\n\n\n\nRehabilitation, behavioural treatment, education, and psychotherapy, etc16,17\n\nQualitative information\n\nTheory/rationale for essential intervention elements\nContent of each session\nMode of delivery (individual/group, face to face/remote)\nWhether the treatment is supervised\nThe content of the information exchanged with participants\nThe materials used to give information\nProcedure for tailoring the intervention to individual participants\nWhether and how the interventions were standardised\nBackground and expertise of individuals delivering the interventions\nWhether the same care providers delivered interventions across trial groups\nWhether and how adherence of individuals delivering the interventions to the protocol was assessed or enhanced\nWhether and how adherence of patients to the intervention protocol was assessed and/or enhanced\nAny physical or informational materials used in the intervention and where the materials can be accessed.\n\nQuantitative information\n\nIntensity of the intervention where appropriate\nNumber of sessions\nSession schedule\nSession duration\nDuration of each main component of each session\nOverall duration of the intervention.\n\n\n\n\nSurgery, technical procedure, or implantable device16\n\nPreoperative care relevant details\nIntraoperative care relevant details\nConfiguration of any device\nPostoperative care relevant details\nProcedure for tailoring the intervention to individual participants\nWhether and how the interventions were standardised\nBackground and expertise of individuals delivering the interventions\nWhether the same care providers delivered interventions across trial groups\nWhether and how adherence of individuals delivering the interventions to the protocol was assessed or enhanced\nAny physical or informational materials used in the intervention and where the materials can be accessed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing fidelity and adherence can be complex and vary according to the intervention/comparator (eg, one-off, short term repeated, long term repeated). Various deviations to the protocol can occur. For example, participants might initiate the intervention but then discontinue the intervention completely and permanently after a specific period of time, discontinue the intervention temporarily, reduce the dose, or modify the schedule. If relevant, authors should provide the prespecified definition for classifying participants as being treated as planned or not.\nIn addition, authors should indicate whether criteria were used to guide intervention/comparator modifications and discontinuations and where applicable describe these criteria. This information could be particularly important to evaluate the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions,18,19 an important domain of the risk-of-bias tool developed by Cochrane.18 Assessing this domain requires a clear understanding of, and ability to distinguish between, deviations that occur as planned in the protocol and deviations that arise due to the experimental context.\nThe research question (ie, explanatory v pragmatic) will affect the standardisation of the intervention/comparator as well as how adherence or fidelity is assessed or enhanced. In explanatory trials, the aim is to estimate treatment effect under ideal circumstances. The intervention/comparator are usually highly standardised with close monitoring of fidelity and adherence to the intervention/comparator and strategies to increase them. In contrast, pragmatic trials aim to determine treatment effect in clinical conditions. The intervention and comparator are usually highly flexible, and measurement of fidelity and adherence are unobstructive with no strategies to maintain or improve them. Nevertheless, assessing fidelity and adherence to the intervention/comparator, or at least recording the most important components of the intervention/comparator, is necessary to understand what was actually administered to participants. This is particularly important for complex interventions where diversity in the implementation of the intervention is expected. For example, in a pragmatic trial assessing a surgical procedure where the procedure is left to surgeons’ choice, investigators should plan to systematically record key elements related to pre-operative care, anaesthesia, the surgical approach, and post-operative care. This information is essential to provide a relevant description of the intervention that was actually provided when the trial is completed.\nIf the control group or intervention group received a combination of interventions, the authors should provide a thorough description of each intervention, an explanation of the order in which the combination of interventions were planned to be introduced or withdrawn, and the triggers for their introduction if applicable. Some complex interventions will require the development of specific documentation (eg, training materials, intervention manuals). Authors should make these available and indicate where they can be accessed.\nIf the control group is to receive usual care, it is important to describe what that constitutes so that readers can assess whether the comparator differs substantially from usual care in their own setting.20 Various approaches could be used: standardising usual care to be in line with specific guidelines; or asking practitioners to treat control patients according to their own preference, which could result in heterogeneity of the care provided particularly between centres and over time.21 Usual care can vary substantially across sites and patients, as well as over the duration of the trial. Further, it is important to clarify if the experimental group also received usual care in addition to the experimental intervention, and what actually differed between the groups. Usual care is frequently incompletely reported. In a review of 214 paediatric trials, the descriptions of standard of care were more often incomplete than the description of the intervention arms within the same study as measured by the TIDieR checklist (mean 5.81 (standard deviation (SD) 2.13) v 8.45 (SD 1.39)).11\nIf the control group is to receive a placebo, specific considerations need to be accounted for. Some evidence showed that placebos are insufficiently described.22 Placebo could have several different aspects from pills to saline injections or more complex interventions such as sham interventions (eg, sham surgery) or attention control interventions. Authors should report the same level of details as required for the intervention—that is, content of the placebo or different component of the placebo, how and when it should be administered, material, procedure for tailoring the placebo to individual participants, and how fidelity and adherence were assessed or enhanced.13 Complete reporting of the placebo is needed to understand what intervention effect is measured in the trial.23 A network meta-analysis of osteoarthritis trials showed that different placebo interventions (oral, intra-articular, topical, oral and topical) had different effects and can impact the relative effect estimate of active treatments.24\nFurther, the trial groups could receive different concomitant care in addition to the assigned trial interventions. Concomitant care could impact trial outcomes and bias effect estimates. To facilitate interpretation of study results and risk-of-bias assessments, authors should report relevant concomitant care that was allowed or prohibited where relevant.\nSpecific guidance has been developed to improve the reporting of interventions, particularly TIDieR,17 TIDieR-Placebo for placebo and sham controls,13 and the CONSORT extensions for non-pharmacological treatments.16 Authors could consult these for more detailed information.",

    "text": "Explanation\nConcomitant care refers to any additional treatments, interventions, or medications that participants may have received during the trial period, in addition to the study interventions. Relevant concomitant care refers to interventions that could have affected the outcome. Transparently reporting this information is essential for readers to understand the context in which the trial was conducted and be able to assess the potential influence of concomitant care on the trial’s results. Particularly, readers should be aware of any unequal use of concomitant care that might affect the outcome between the intervention and comparator groups.2 This is particularly important when the trials are not fully blinded.3 This information could be particularly important for evaluating the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions, an important domain of the risk-of-bias tool developed by Cochrane.4,5\nNevertheless, this information is poorly reported. A review of 164 cardiovascular clinical trials published in five influential medical journals from 2011 to 2021 showed that cointerventions were inadequately reported in 71% of the trials6 and that trials with deficient reporting had larger treatment effect estimates on average.7 In rheumatology, an assessment of 109 trials in leading journals from 2018 to 2020 found that only 57% of randomised trials provided the number of patients on concomitant medications at baseline, and only 5% reported the cumulative or mean exposure data for concomitant medications.8\nAuthors should report the number and percentage of participants receiving the different relevant concomitant care in each arm and, where relevant, the cumulative or average for each concomitant intervention taken over the trial period for each group.",

    "text": "Explanation\nFor each primary and secondary outcome, the number of participants included in each group is an essential element of the analyses. Although the flow diagram (item 22a) should indicate the numbers of participants included in the analysis of the primary outcome, the number of participants with available data will often vary for different outcomes and at different time points.\nMissing data can introduce potential bias through different types of participants being included in each treatment group. It can also reduce, through loss of information, the power to detect a difference between treatment groups if one exists (item 21c) and reduce the generalisability of the trial findings.4 It is therefore important to report the number of participants with available data for each primary and secondary outcome and at each timepoint. Where possible, it is also important to report the reason data were not available, for example, if the participant did not attend follow-up appointments, or if data were truncated because the participant died.4 The extent and causes of missing data can vary. For example, a systematic review of palliative care trials estimated that 23% of primary outcome data were not available5; this compares to a recent review of trials published in four top general medical journals where the median percentage of participants with a missing outcome was around 9%.6\nTrial results are often more clearly displayed in a table rather than in the text, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. For each outcome, results should be reported as a summary of the outcome in each group (eg, the number of participants included in the analysis with or without the event and the denominators, or the mean and standard deviation of measurements), together with the contrast between the groups, known as the effect size. For binary outcomes, the effect size could be the risk ratio (relative risk), odds ratio, or risk difference; for survival time data, it could be the hazard ratio or difference in median survival time; and for continuous data, it is usually the difference in means.\nFor all outcomes, authors should provide a CI to indicate the precision (uncertainty) of the estimated effect size.7,8 A 95% CI is conventional, but occasionally other levels are used. Most journals require or strongly encourage the use of CIs.9 They are especially valuable in relation to differences that do not meet conventional statistical significance, for which they often indicate that the result does not rule out an important clinical difference. The use of CIs has increased markedly in recent years, although not in all medical specialties.10 A common error is the presentation of separate CIs for the outcome in each group rather than for the treatment effect.10 Although P values may be provided in addition to CIs, results should not be reported solely as P values.11,12 Results should be reported for all planned primary and secondary outcomes and at each time point, not just for analyses that were statistically significant or thought to be interesting. Selective reporting within studies is a widespread and serious problem.1314\nWhen the primary outcome is binary, both the relative effect (risk ratio (relative risk) or odds ratio), and the absolute effect (risk difference) should be reported (with CIs) (Table 3), as neither the relative measure nor the absolute measure alone gives a complete picture of the effect and its implications. Different audiences may prefer either relative or absolute risk, but both clinicians and lay people tend to overestimate the effect when it is presented solely in terms of relative risk.1516,17 The magnitude of the risk difference is less generalisable to other populations than the relative risk since it depends on the baseline risk in the unexposed group, which tends to vary across populations. For diseases where the outcome is common, a relative risk near unity might nonetheless indicate clinically important differences in public health terms. In contrast, a large relative risk when the outcome is rare may not be so important for public health (although it may be important to an individual in a high risk category). For both binary and survival time data, expressing the results also as the number needed to treat for benefit or harm can be helpful.1819",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nAll randomised trials assess outcomes, for which the groups are compared. Most trials have several outcomes, some of which are of more importance than others. The primary outcome is the prespecified outcome considered to be of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders (such as patients, policy makers, clinicians, and funders) and should be the one used in the sample size calculation (item 16). The primary outcome should be explicitly indicated as such in the report of a randomised trial. Other outcomes of interest are secondary outcomes.\nIt is important to explain the rationale and clinical relevance for chosen efficacy and harm outcomes, including whether they are part of a core outcome set.2,3 A core outcome set is an agreed standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or health care. The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) initiative and COMET database facilitate access to core outcome sets (https://www.comet-initiative.org/).\nMost trials have a single primary outcome. Having several primary outcomes can incur potential problems of interpretation associated with multiplicity of analyses (items 28 and 30). There are typically multiple secondary outcomes (ie, the outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol to assess any additional effects of the intervention). Secondary outcomes can include harms that may include unintended effects of the intervention (item 27).\nThe primary and secondary outcomes reported should be consistent with the outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol and the registry. Evidence shows important discrepancies between the outcome reported in the registry or protocol and outcomes reported in final publications, frequently in favour of statistically significant results. Any change in outcome(s) specified in the protocol should be reported, with reasons (item 10).4–6\nAll outcomes, whether primary or secondary, should be described and completely defined. This information is typically also detailed in the trial’s protocol and the trial registry. The principle here is that the information provided should be sufficient to allow others to use the same outcomes.7 For each outcome, it is important to detail: (1) the specific measurement variable, which corresponds to the data collected directly from trial participants (eg, Beck Depression Scale; all cause mortality) with definition where relevant (eg, major bleeding was defined as fatal bleeding or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ; all cause mortality per hospital database); (2) the specific participant level analysis metric, which corresponds to the format of the outcome data that was used from each trial participant for analysis (eg, change from baseline; final value or value at a time point; time to event); (3) the method of aggregation, which refers to the summary measure format for each trial group (eg, mean; proportion of participants with score &gt;2); and (4) the measurement time point of interest for analysis.8 For composite outcomes, all individual components of the composite outcome should be described as secondary outcomes.1 Only half of randomised trials published in PubMed indexed journals in 2000 and 2006 specified the primary outcome.9,10 In recent samples of trials published in specific fields, reporting has improved but still two thirds did not provide a complete definition.11,12\nThe use of previously developed and validated scales can help to enhance quality of measurement.13,14 For example, assessment of health related quality of life using a validated instrument is critical to the integrity and applicability of the trial.15 Authors should report measurement properties of outcome measurement instruments to assist in interpretation and comparison with similar studies.16\nIn most trials, information on outcomes is set to be collected as part of the trial conduct. However, some trials may use existing data collecting structures (eg, national, healthcare or administrative registries). This should be clarified in the methods. There is empirical evidence that treatment effect estimates may be different in trials where outcomes are obtained from routinely collected data.17",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe design and conduct of some randomised trials are straightforward, and the flow of participants, particularly where there are no losses to follow-up or exclusions, through each phase of the study can be described relatively easily. For other trials, it can be difficult for readers to discern whether and why some participants did not receive the treatment as allocated, were lost to follow-up, or were excluded from the analysis.3 This information is crucial for several reasons. Participants who were excluded after allocation are unlikely to be representative of all participants in the study. For example, participants may not be available for follow-up evaluation because they experienced an acute exacerbation of their illness or harms of treatment.4,5\nAttrition as a result of loss to follow-up, which is often unavoidable, needs to be distinguished from investigator-determined exclusion for such reasons as ineligibility, withdrawal from treatment, and poor adherence to the trial protocol. Erroneous conclusions can be reached if participants are excluded from analysis, and imbalances in such omissions between groups may be especially indicative of bias.56,7 Information about whether the investigators included in the analysis all participants who underwent randomisation, in the groups to which they were originally allocated (item 21b), is therefore of particular importance. Knowing the number of participants who did not receive the intervention as allocated or did not complete treatment permits the reader to assess to what extent the estimated efficacy of therapy might be underestimated in comparison with ideal circumstances.\nIf available, the number of people assessed for eligibility, and reason for exclusion, should also be reported. Although this number is relevant to external validity only and is arguably less important than the other counts,8 it is a useful indicator of whether trial participants were likely to be representative of all eligible participants.\nA suggested template for reporting the number of participants who were randomly assigned, received intended treatment, were lost to follow-up, and were analysed for the primary outcome is shown in figure 1, and the counts required are described in detail in Table 1. A review of randomised trials published in general medical journals found that reporting of what happened to participants and their data was considerably more thorough in articles that included a diagram of the flow of participants through a trial than in those that did not.3\n\n\n\nTable 1: Information required to document the flow of participants through each stage of a randomised trial for the primary outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\nNo of people included\nNo of people not included or excluded\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nEnrolment\nPeople evaluated for potential enrolment\nPeople who did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the inclusion criteria but declined to be enrolled\nThese counts indicate whether trial participants were likely to be representative of all patients seen; they are relevant to assessment of external validity only, and they are often not available\n\n\nRandomisation\nParticipants randomly assigned\n— Cr\nucial count for defining trial size and assessing whether a trial has been analysed by intention-to-treat\n\n\nTreatment allocation\nParticipants who received intervention as allocated, by trial group\nParticipants who did not receive intervention as allocated, by trial group\nImportant counts for assessment of internal validity and interpretation of results; reasons for not receiving intervention as allocated should be given\n\n\nFollow-up\nParticipants who completed intervention as allocated, by trial group\nParticipants who completed follow-up as planned, by trial group\nParticipants who did not complete intervention as allocated, by trial group\nParticipants who did not complete follow-up as planned, by trial group\nImportant counts for assessment of internal validity and interpretation of results; reasons for not completing intervention or follow-up should be given\n\n\nAnalysis\nParticipants included in main analysis for the primary outcome, by trial group\nParticipants excluded from main analysis for the primary outcome, by trial group\nCrucial count for assessing whether a trial has been analysed by intention-to-treat; reasons for excluding participants should be given\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome information, such as the number of individuals assessed for eligibility, may not always be known,9 and depending on the nature of a trial, some counts may be more relevant than others. It will sometimes be useful or necessary to adapt the structure of the flow diagram to a particular trial. In some situations, other information may usefully be added. For example, for trials of non-pharmacological interventions it may be important to report the number of care providers or centres performing the intervention in each group and the number of participants treated by each care provider or in each centre.10\nThe exact form and content of the flow diagram may be varied according to specific features of a trial. For example, many trials of surgery or vaccination do not include the possibility of discontinuation. Although CONSORT strongly recommends using a flow diagram to communicate participant flow throughout the study, there is no specific, prescribed format.",

    "text": "Explanation\nA protocol for the complete trial (rather than a protocol of a specific procedure within a trial, such as for the intervention) is important because it prespecifies the methods of the randomised trial, for example, the primary outcome (item 14). Having a protocol provides important context to interpret a trial, implement its findings, and facilitate replication and appraisal of risk of bias. It can also help to restrict the likelihood of undeclared post hoc changes to the trial methods and selective outcome reporting (item 10).2–4 Elements that are important to address in the protocol for a randomised trial are described in the SPIRIT 2025 statement.5\nA protocol may either include the full statistical analysis plan or may include a section outlining the main principles while referencing and reporting the full statistical analysis plan as a separate, more detailed document. The statistical analysis plan typically includes details about several aspects of the clinical trial, such as the data analysis plan for the primary outcome(s) and all secondary outcomes. Details about what to include in a statistical analysis plan can be found elsewhere.6\nThe protocol should be signed off by the trial steering committee before the allocation of any participants and data collection. Similarly, the full statistical analysis plan should be signed off by the trial steering committee before the dataset is closed for analysis. This allows transparent documentation of any subsequent changes to either document. In many trials, changes to the protocol and statistical analysis plan may happen after the trial onset for legitimate reasons (eg, in response to challenges that were not anticipated or new evidence). In these cases, each iteration of the protocol and statistical analysis plan should record the changes along with their rationale and timing.\nThere are several options for authors to consider to ensure their trial protocol, and full statistical analysis plan where applicable, are accessible to interested readers. The protocol and full statistical analysis plan (and their various iterations) can be stored in a repository, such as the Open Science Framework, which is free to use and access for all readers. Openness and accessibility are core elements of open science (see Open science section). Trial protocols and statistical analysis plans can also be published in journals such as Trials and BMJ Open. Open access publication would ensure that any reader, including patients and the public, can access the document. Trial registration (item 2) will also ensure that a minimum set of trial protocol details are available as part of the trial’s registration (https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform), but often a registration record leaves large ambiguity about key protocol issues and statistical analyses. The more detailed trial protocol can also be posted on most clinical trial registries.\nIdeally, the authors should give access to the protocol signed off by the trial steering committee before the allocation of any participants and data collection with any subsequent changes with their rationale and timing.\nWhen submitting a completed trial report, trial authors can include their protocol as a supplemental document or provide a URL to its location. Such documentation can facilitate peer review and help identify reporting biases.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIn trials of several hundred participants or more, simple randomisation can usually be trusted to generate similar numbers in the two trial groups6 and to generate groups that are roughly comparable in terms of known and unknown prognostic variables.7 For smaller trials of fewer than around 200 participants,8 which are common, some form of restricted randomisation procedure to help achieve balance between groups in size or characteristics may be useful (box 6). However, larger trials of greater than approximately 200 participants may also benefit from registration. For example, they may stop before reaching their target size, they may need more power at interim analyses, or they may benefit from stratification with restriction.\n\nRandomisation and minimisation\n\nSimple randomisation\nPure randomisation based on a single allocation ratio is known as simple randomisation. Simple randomisation with a 1:1 allocation ratio is analogous to a coin toss, although we do not advocate coin tossing for randomisation in a randomised trial. The term “simple” is somewhat of a misnomer. While other randomisation schemes sound complex and more sophisticated, in reality, simple randomisation is elegantly sophisticated in that it is more unpredictable and could surpass the bias prevention levels of all other alternatives.\n\n\nRestricted randomisation\nRestricted randomisation specifies any randomised approach that is not simple randomisation. Blocked randomisation is the most common form. Other means of restricted randomisation include replacement, biased coin, and urn randomisation, although these are used much less frequently.8\n\n\nBlocked randomisation\nBlocking can be used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any time during the trial. After a block of every eight participants was assigned, for example, four would be allocated to each arm of the trial.9 Improved balance comes at the cost of reducing the unpredictability of the sequence. Although the order of interventions varies randomly within each block, a person running the trial could deduce some of the next treatment allocations if they discovered the block size.10 Blinding the interventions, using larger block sizes, and randomly varying the block size can ameliorate this problem.\n\n\nStratified randomisation\nStratification is used to ensure a good balance of participant characteristics in each group. By chance, particularly in small trials, trial groups may not be well matched for baseline characteristics, such as age and stage of disease. This weakens the trial’s credibility.11 Such imbalances can be avoided without sacrificing the advantages of randomisation. Stratification ensures that the numbers of participants receiving each intervention are closely balanced within each stratum. Stratified randomisation is achieved by performing a separate randomisation procedure within each of two or more subsets of participants (eg, those defining each centre, age, or disease severity). Stratification by centre is common in multicentre trials. Stratification requires some form of restriction, such as blocking within strata. Stratification without some form of restriction is ineffective.\n\n\nMinimisation\nMinimisation improves balance between intervention groups for several selected patient factors (eg, age).12,13 The first patient is truly randomly allocated; for each subsequent participant, the treatment allocation that minimises the imbalance on the selected factors between groups at that time is identified. That allocation may then be used, or a choice may be made at random with a heavy weighting in favour of the intervention that would minimise imbalance (eg, with a probability of 0.8). The use of a random component is generally preferable. Minimisation has the advantage of creating small groups closely similar in terms of measurable participant characteristics at all stages of the trial.\nMinimisation offers the only acceptable alternative to randomisation, and some have argued that it is superior.14 Conversely, minimisation lacks the theoretical basis for eliminating bias on all known and unknown factors. Nevertheless, in general, trials that use minimisation are considered methodologically equivalent to randomised trials, even when a random element is not incorporated.\nIt is important to indicate whether no restriction was used by stating such or by stating that simple randomisation was done. Otherwise, the methods used to restrict the randomisation, along with the method used for random selection, should be specified. For blocked randomisation, authors should provide details on how the blocks were generated (eg, by using a permuted block design with a computer random number generator), the block size or sizes, and whether the block size was fixed or randomly varied. If the trialists became aware of the block size(s), that information should also be reported as such knowledge could lead to them correctly deciphering future treatment assignments. Authors should specify whether stratification was used and, if so, which factors (eg, recruitment site, sex, disease stage) were involved; the categorisation cut-off thresholds within stratums; and the method used for restriction. Although stratification is a useful technique, especially for smaller trials, it can be complicated to implement and may not perform as well as expected if many stratifying factors are used. If minimisation (box 6) was used, it should be explicitly identified, as should the variables incorporated into the scheme; whether a random element was used should also be stated.\nWith blocking, although the order of interventions varies randomly within each block, individuals running the trial could deduce some of the future treatment allocations if they discovered the block size.10 Discovering block sizes is much more likely in unblinded trials, where treatment allocations become known after assignment (box 6). Certain techniques, such as large block sizes and randomly varying block sizes, can help prevent the deciphering of future treatment allocations. Unfortunately, particularly with unblinded trials, a review “found that very few trials used techniques that would eliminate the risk of selection bias,” and that “These findings indicate that a substantial proportion of unblinded trials are at risk of selection bias.”15 Indeed, in a recent study of 179 open, unblinded randomised trials, small block sizes were associated with subversion.16\nOnly 9% of 206 reports of trials in specialty journals17 and 39% of 80 trials in general medical journals reported use of stratification.18 In each case, only about half of the reports mentioned the use of restricted randomisation. Those studies and that of Adetugbo and Williams19 found that the sizes of the treatment groups in many trials were very often the same or quite similar, yet blocking or stratification had not been mentioned. One of a few possible causes of this close balance in numbers is under-reporting of the use of restricted randomisation, although non-random manipulation of treatment assignments is also suspected. A more recent study of 298 reports of trials in general medical journals found 69% reported the use of a stratified block method.20",

    "text": "Explanation\nArguably, trialists who arbitrarily conduct unplanned interim analyses after very few events accrue using no statistical guidelines run a high risk of catching the data at a random extreme, which likely represents a large overestimate of treatment benefit.3\nReaders will likely draw weaker inferences from a trial that was truncated in a data driven manner versus one that reports its findings after reaching a results-independent goal (see below). Where relevant, authors should report the reason for stopping the trial before completion as planned (eg, result of an interim analysis, lack of funding, poor recruitment of participants, intervention no longer available, or the question becoming no longer relevant after publication of another study). Authors should also disclose factors extrinsic to the trial that affected the decision to stop the trial, and who made the decision to stop the trial, including reporting the role the funding agency had in the deliberations and in the decision to stop the trial.4\n\nEarly stopping of randomised trials\n\nRandomised trials can end when they reach their sample size goal, their event count goal, their length of follow-up goal, or their scheduled date of closure. In these situations, the trial will stop in a manner independent of its results and stopping is unlikely to introduce bias in the results. Alternatively, randomised trials can stop earlier than planned because of the result of an interim analysis showing larger than expected benefit or harm of the experimental intervention. Randomised trials can also stop earlier than planned when investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions (ie, stopping for futility). In addition, trials may stop early because the trial becomes unviable: funding vanishes, researchers cannot access eligible patients or study interventions, or the results of other studies make the research question irrelevant.\nFull reporting of why a trial ended is important for evidence based decision making (item 23b). Researchers4 examining why 143 trials stopped early for benefit found that many failed to report key methodological information regarding how the decision to stop was reached: the planned sample size (n=28), interim analysis after which the trial was stopped (n=45), or whether a stopping rule informed the decision (n=48). Item 16b of the CONSORT checklist requires the reporting of timing of interim analyses, what triggered them, how many took place, whether these were planned or ad hoc, and whether there were statistical guidelines and stopping rules in place a priori. Furthermore, it is helpful to know whether an independent data monitoring committee participated in the analyses (and who composed it, with particular attention to the role of the funding source), and who made the decision to stop. Often the data monitoring committee make recommendations and the funders (sponsors) or the investigators make the decision to stop.\nTrials that stop early for reasons apparently independent of trial findings, and trials that reach their planned termination, are unlikely to introduce bias by stopping.5 In these cases, the authors should report whether interim analyses took place and whether these results were available to the funder.\nThe push for trials that change the intervention in response to interim results, thus enabling a faster evaluation of promising interventions for rapidly evolving and fatal conditions, will require even more careful reporting of the process and decision to stop trials early.6,7\nA systematic review of 143 randomised trials that were stopped earlier than planned for benefit found that these trials reported stopping after accruing a median of 66 events. The review estimated a median relative risk of 0.47 and a strong association between the number of events accrued and the magnitude of the effect, with smaller trials with fewer events yielding the largest treatment effects (odds ratio 31, 95% CI 12 to 82).4 While an increasing number of trials published in high impact medical journals report stopping early, many still do not report how the decision to stop the trial was made. In a systematic review of 110 paediatric trials that reported on the presence of a data monitoring committee, interim analysis, or early stopping, 32 were terminated early. Of these 32 trials, 22 (69%) did not report predefined stopping guidelines and 15 (47%) did not provide information on statistical monitoring methods.8",

Statistical significance and futility boundaries were estimated for the interim and final analysis based on 50,000 simulations from the PASS® software (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah) by simulating a group sequential test for two means assuming normality testing. At the interim analysis, the two-sided significance boundary for clinical efficacy was 0.00312 and for futility of detecting μAUT00063 &gt; μplacebo, the one-sided O’Brien-Fleming boundary was 0.39,141. Hence, at the final analysis, the two-sided significance boundary for clinical efficacy would be 0.04761.

Futility boundaries were based on testing the alternative hypothesis at the 0.039 level.”3\n“Two interim analyses to be performed using the Haybittle-Peto approach were scheduled, after enrolment of 1000 and 2000 patients, respectively. The significance level associated with both interim analyses was 0.001 and the significance level associated with the final analysis was 0.049.

    "text": "Explanation\nNumerous randomised trials enrol participants over extended periods of time. If an intervention demonstrates exceptional efficacy, the study might require early termination on ethical grounds. To mitigate this concern, assessing results as data accumulates is advisable, ideally through an independent data monitoring committee (DMC), sometimes referred to as a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB).5 However, conducting multiple statistical evaluations on accruing data without proper adjustment may result in misleading conclusions. For instance, examining data from a trial at five interim analyses using a P value of 0.05 would elevate the overall false-positive rate closer to 19% rather than the expected 5%. Further to stopping early for efficacy, interim analyses can be used to evaluate (1) futility, to assess whether a trial is likely to meet its objectives; or (2) safety, to assess whether there is evidence for increased risk of harms (in the intervention group relative to the comparator group).5 Interim analyses can also be used to reassess the sample size, using updated information from interim trial data (eg, through an internal pilot), to ensure adequate power of the trial.\nVarious group sequential statistical approaches exist to adjust for multiple looks (ie, analyses) at the data, and these should be predetermined in the trial protocol (see item 27a of the SPIRIT 2025 statement6). Using these methods, data are compared at each interim analysis, where a P value below the specified critical value by the chosen group sequential method signifies statistical significance. Some researchers view group sequential methods as a tool for decision making, while others regard them as a definitive stopping point, intending to halt the trial if the observed P value falls below the critical threshold.\nAuthors should disclose whether they or the DMC/DSMB performed multiple looks at the data (interim analyses). If such multiple looks occurred, it is important to specify the frequency; the triggers prompting them; the statistical methods applied (including any formal stopping rules); and whether these procedures were planned and documented in the trial protocol before the trial commenced, before the DMC examined any interim data, or at a later stage. Authors should also report the time point at which any interim analyses where conducted (and by whom); and state who decided to continue, stop or modify the trial, and whether they were blinded to the treatment allocation. Unfortunately, the reporting of interim analyses and stopping rules is frequently inadequate in published trial reports,7 even in cases where trials indeed halted earlier than originally planned.",

Statistical significance of the treatment group parameter was determined (p value generated) through examination of the associated χ2 statistic (obtained from the log-binomial model which produced the RR). Binary secondary outcomes were analysed as per the primary outcome. Time to hCG [human chorionic gonadotrophin] resolution was considered in a competing risk framework to account for participants who had surgical intervention for their ectopic pregnancy. A cumulative incidence function was used to estimate the probability of occurrence (hCG resolution) over time. A Fine and Gray model was then used to estimate a subdistribution adjusted hazard ratio (HR) directly from the cumulative incidence function. In addition, a further Cox proportional hazard model was fitted and applied to the cause-specific (non-surgical resolution) hazard function and used to generate an adjusted HR. Return to menses was analysed using a Cox regression model. Number of hospital visits associated with treatment was analysed using a Poisson regression model, including centre as a random effect to generate an adjusted incidence ratio.”1\n“For the primary continuous outcome and secondary outcomes, linear mixed-effect models were used, with outcome measurement (at the two follow-up timepoints) as the dependent variable. The models included fixed effects for timepoint, treatment, timepoint by treatment interactions, the baseline measure of the outcome, and therapist, assuming a linear relationship between baseline and outcome. The dichotomous outcome of recovery in the delusion was analysed using a logistic mixed-effect model. Persecutory delusion conviction was analysed as a continuous and also as a dichotomous (recovery) variable. The models included a random intercept for participant, an unstructured correlation matrix for the residuals, and were fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation . . . For each outcome and timepoint, we report the treatment effect estimate as the adjusted mean difference between groups, its SE [standard error], 95% CIs [confidence intervals], and p value. In addition, we report estimates for Cohen’s d effect sizes as the adjusted mean difference of the outcome (between the groups) divided by the sample SD [standard deviation] of the outcome at baseline.”2\n“Analyses followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan. The primary outcome (ODQ [Oswestry Disability Questionnaire] score at 18 weeks after randomisation) was compared between groups with a linear regression model, adjusted for baseline ODQ, with centre as a random effect. ODQ score, visual analogue scores (VAS) for back pain, VAS for leg pain, MRM [modified Roland-Morris] outcome score, and COMI [Core Outcome Measures Index] score at all follow-up visits were analysed with a repeated measures mixed-effects model adjusting for baseline outcome measure, treatment group, time (as a continuous variable), and a time-treatment arm interaction (if significant). Centre and participant were random effects in the repeated measures models. A second model adjusted for other prespecified variables, age, sex, duration of symptoms, body-mass index, and size of disc prolapse (as a percentage of the diameter of the spinal canal, categorised as &lt;25%, 25–50%, or &gt;50%).”3\n“We analysed the primary outcome (between-group difference in the SPPB [short physical performance battery] at 12 months) using linear mixed models, adjusted for baseline measurements, minimisation variables (age, sex and CKD [chronic kidney disease] category) and a random effect variable for recruitment site. We analysed secondary outcomes using repeated measures mixed models, including all participants and including data from all available timepoints. Models were adjusted for baseline values and the minimisation variables. We conducted time-to-event analyses (time to death, time to commencing renal replacement therapy) using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for minimisation variables. All participants were included in these analyses, with participants censored at the point of dropout or truncation of follow-up for those not reaching the analysis endpoint before 24 months. For all analyses, we took a two-sided p value of &lt; 0.05 as significant with no adjustment for multiple testing.”4",

    "text": "Explanation\nVarious methods can be used to analyse data, and it is crucial to ensure that the chosen approach is suitable for the specific context. Specifying the statistical procedures and software used for each analysis is essential, and additional clarification may be required in the results section of the report. Authors should describe the statistical methods insufficient detail to allow a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results, as emphasised by the ICMJE (https://www.icmje.org/). It is also important to elaborate on specific aspects of the statistical analysis, such as the intention-to-treat approach.\nDetails of all statistical analyses are frequently prespecified in a statistical analysis plan, a document that accompanies the trial protocol. In the report of the trial results, authors should detail and justify any deviation from the statistical analysis plan or from the protocol if no statistical analysis plan was developed. They should clarify which analyses were prespecified and which were post hoc.\nMost analysis approaches provide an estimate of the treatment effect, representing the difference in outcomes between comparison groups, and authors should also indicate the effect measure (eg, absolute risk) considered. Authors should accompany this with a CI for the estimated effect, delineating a central range of uncertainty regarding the actual treatment effect. The CI may be interpreted as the range of values for the treatment effect that is compatible with the observed data. Typically, a 95% CI is presented, signifying the range anticipated to encompass the true value in 95 of 100 similar studies.\nStudy findings can also be assessed in terms of their statistical significance. The P value represents the probability that the observed data (or a more extreme result) could have arisen by chance when the interventions did not truly differ. The statistical significance level that will be used should be reported. In the results section, actual P values (for example, P=0.001) are strongly preferable to imprecise threshold reports such as P&lt;0.05.5,6\nSome trials may use bayesian methods.7–910 In this case, the choices of priors, computational decisions, and any modelling methods used should be described. Most bayesian trials so far have been for early phases of drug development, but this approach can be applicable to any phase. Typically, results are presented as treatment effects along with credible intervals.\nWhere an analysis lacks statistical power (eg, harms outcomes), authors may prefer descriptive approaches over formal statistical analysis.\nWhile the necessity for covariate adjustments is generally reduced in randomised trials compared with epidemiological studies, considering an adjusted analysis can have value in terms of increased power and precision, particularly if there is an indication that one or more variables may have prognostic value.11 It is preferable for adjusted analyses to be explicitly outlined in the study protocol (item 3). For instance, it is often advisable to make adjustments for stratification variables,12 in keeping with the principle that the analysis strategy should align with the study design. In the context of randomised trials, the decision to make adjustments should not be based on whether there are baseline covariates that are statistically significantly different between randomised groups. The testing of baseline imbalance in covariates should be avoided,11 as if randomisation is properly conducted, then by definition, any differences in baseline covariates between treatment arms are random. The rationale for any adjusted analyses and the statistical methods used should be specified, along with clarifying the choice of covariates that were adjusted for, indicating how continuous variables were handled (eg, linear, modelled with splines),13 and specifying whether the analysis was planned or post hoc. Reviews of published studies show that reporting of adjusted analyses is inadequate with regard to all of these aspects.14,15\nMultiplicity issues are prevalent in trials and merit special consideration, especially in cases involving multiple primary outcomes, multiple time points stemming from repeated assessments of an outcome, multiple planned analyses for an outcome (such as interim or subgroup analyses (item 21d)), or analyses of numerous secondary outcomes (see CONSORT outcomes extension for more details).16 Any methods used to mitigate or account for multiplicity should be described. If no methods have been used to account for multiplicity (eg, not applicable, or not considered), then this should also be reported, particularly when a large number of analyses has been carried out.",

The imputation models contained all the variables of the analysis model(s) as well as factors associated with missingness: age (identified empirically to predict missingness, P = .03) and adherence (number of doses taken of either vitamin D or placebo, P &lt; .001).”1\n“To consider the potential impact of missing data on trial conclusions, we used multiple imputation (data missing at random) and sensitivity analysis (data not missing at random). Multiple imputation by chained equations was performed using the”mi impute chained” command in Stata. We used a linear regression model to impute missing outcomes for the HOS ADL [activities of daily living subscale of the hip outcome score] at eight months post-randomisation. Variables in the imputation model included all covariates in the analysis model (baseline HOS ADL (continuous), age (continuous), and sex). In addition, we included other variables that were thought to be predictive of the outcome (lateral centre-edge angle, maximum α angle, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, and baseline HADS score). Imputations were run separately by treatment arm and based on a predictive mean matching approach, choosing at random one of the five HOS ADL values with the closest predicted scores. Missing data in the covariates that were included in the multiple imputation model were imputed simultaneously (multiple imputation by chained equation approach). Sensitivity analysis was performed using the “rctmiss” command in Stata, and we considered scenarios where participants with missing data in each arm were assumed to have outcomes that were up to 9 points worse than when data were missing at random.”2\n“Analyses for the 2 primary outcomes compared each treatment with usual care using multiple imputation to handle missing data and a Bonferroni-corrected 2-tailed type I error of .025. We performed 20 imputations with a fully conditional specification using Proc MI in SAS. Imputation was performed with the following prespecified variables: age, study group, study site, clinic, sex, race and ethnicity, body mass index, exercise frequency at baseline, education, employment status, smoking status, other medical conditions at baseline, number of medications used for spine pain at baseline, duration of pain at baseline, number of previous pain episodes, STarT Back score, baseline ODI, baseline self-efficacy, baseline EQ-5D-5L, and scores for patient-reported outcomes at every follow-up point (ODI [Oswestry Disability Index], cost, Lorig et al self-efficacy scale, and EQ-5D-5L [EuroQol 5-dimensional 5-level questionnaire]). Each imputed data set was analyzed separately using Proc GENMOD in SAS (with an identity link and normally distributed errors for ODI and a log link and Poisson-distributed errors for spine-related spending).”3\n“Missing peak V̇o2 [oxygen consumption] data at week 20, regardless of the type of intercurrent event, was imputed using multiple imputation methodology under the missing at random assumption for the primary analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed by exploring a missing not at random assumption in the imputation of peak V̇o2. The imputation model used a regression multiple imputation, which includes treatment group, baseline respiratory exchange ratio, persistent atrial fibrillation (yes or no), age, sex, baseline peak V̇o2, baseline hemoglobin level, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline body weight, baseline KCCQ [Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire] total symptom score, baseline NYHA [New York Heart Association] class, and baseline average daily activity units (refers to 10 hours of wearing during the awake time for ≥7 days unless otherwise specified). Treatment group, persistent atrial fibrillation (yes or no), baseline NYHA class, and sex were treated as categorical variables. Fifty imputed data sets were generated. Each of the imputed data sets was analyzed using the analysis of covariance model of the primary analysis. Least square mean (LSM) treatment difference and the standard error were combined using Rubin’s rules to produce an LSM estimate of the treatment difference, its 95% CI [confidence interval], and P value for the test of null hypothesis of no treatment effect.”4\n“Multiple imputation was preplanned for the primary outcome measure in the case of missing data; however, because there were no missing data relating to ventilator-free days, imputation was not required.”5",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nMissing data are common when conducting medical research. Collecting data on all study participants can be challenging even in a trial that has mechanisms to maximise data capture. Missing values can occur in either the outcome or in one or more covariates, or usually both. There are many reasons why missing values occur in the outcome. Patients may stop participating in the trial, withdraw consent for further data collection, or fail to attend follow-up visits; all of which could be related to the treatment allocation, specific (prognostic) factors, or experiencing a specific health outcome.6 Missing values could also occur in baseline variables, such that all the necessary data needed to conduct the trial have been only partially recorded. Despite the ubiquity of missing data in medical research, the reporting of missing data and how they are handled in the analyses is poor.78–14 15\nMany trialists exclude patients without an observed outcome. Once any randomised participants are excluded, the analysis is not strictly an intention-to-treat analysis. Most randomised trials have some missing observations. Trialists effectively must choose between omitting the participants without final outcome data, imputing their missing outcome data, or using model based approaches such as fitting a linear mixed model to repeated measures data.16 A complete case (or available case) analysis includes only those participants whose outcome is known. While a few missing outcomes will not cause a problem, many trials have more than 10% of randomised patients with missing outcomes.78–14 This common situation will result in loss of power by reducing the sample size, and bias may well be introduced if being lost to follow-up is related to a participant’s response to treatment. There should be concern when the frequency or the causes of dropping out differ between the intervention groups.\nParticipants with missing outcomes can be included in the analysis if their outcomes are imputed (ie, their outcomes are estimated from other information that was collected) or if using a model based approach. Imputing the values of missing data allows the analysis to potentially conform to intention-to-treat analysis but requires strong assumptions, which may be hard to justify. Simple imputation methods are appealing, but their use may be inadvisable as they fail to account for uncertainty introduced by missing data and may lead to invalid inferences (eg, estimated standard errors for the treatment effect will be too small).17 For randomised trials with missing data within repeated measures data, model based approaches such as fitting a linear mixed model can be used to estimate the treatment effect at the final time point which is valid under a missing-at-random assumption. A model is fit at a (limited) number of time points following randomisation, by including fixed effects for time and randomised group and their interaction.16\nAnother approach that is sometimes used is known as “last observation carried forward,” in which missing final values of the outcome variable are replaced by the last known value before the participant was lost to follow-up. Although this method might appear appealing through its simplicity, the underlying assumption will rarely be valid, so the method may introduce bias, and makes no allowance for the uncertainty of imputation. The approach of last observation carried forward has been severely criticised.18–20 Sensitivity analyses should be reported to understand the extent to which the results of the trial depend on the missing data assumptions and subsequent analysis (item 21d).21 When the findings from the sensitivity analyses are consistent with the results from the primary analysis (eg, complete case for the primary analysis and multiple imputation for a sensitivity analysis), trialists can be reassured that the missing data assumptions and associated methods had little impact on the trial results.22\nRegardless of what data are missing, how such data are to be analysed and reported needs to be carefully planned. Authors should provide a description on how missing data were handled in sufficient detail to allow for the analysis to be reproduced (in principle; see the box below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidance for reporting analytical approaches to handle missing data (adapted from Hussain et al23)\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nReport any strategies used to reduce missing data throughout the trial process.\nReport if and/or how the original sample size calculation accounted for missing data (item 16a) and the justification for these decisions.

Include whether or which auxiliary variables were collected and used.\nReport the assumptions about the missing data mechanism (eg, missing at random) and methods used to conduct the missing data sensitivity analyses for all outcomes, and the justification for the assumptions and methods chosen.\nReport how data that were truncated due to death or other causes were handled with a justification for the method(s) (if relevant).\n\n\n\nResults\n\nReport the numbers and proportions of missing data in each trial arm.\nReport the reasons for missing data in each trial arm.\nReport a comparison of the characteristics of those with observed and missing data.\nReport the primary analysis based on the primary assumption about the missing data mechanism, for all outcomes.\nReport results of the missing data sensitivity analyses for all outcomes. As a minimum, a summary of the missing data sensitivity analyses should be reported in the main paper with the full results in the supplementary material.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nDiscuss the impact of missing data on the interpretation of findings, considering both internal and external validity.

    "text": "Explanation\nThe consequences of non-publication of entire trials (ie, publication bias),2–4 and of selective reporting of outcomes and analyses within trials, have been well documented.5,67 For almost 40 years, there have been growing calls to address these practices. Today, a ubiquitous view recommends trial registration as the best practice to achieve this goal, and inform policymakers and potential participants about ongoing trials. Registering clinical trials, before any assignment of participants, with unique trial identification numbers and other basic information about the trial so that essential details are made publicly available, is a minimum best practice.8–11 Serious problems of withholding data12 led to renewed efforts to ensure registration of randomised trials. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that “the registration of all interventional trials is a scientific, ethical and moral responsibility.”13\nIn September 2004, the ICMJE established a policy that it would only consider trials for publication if they had been registered before the enrolment of the first participant.14 This policy resulted in a substantial increase in the number of trials being registered.15 However, some trials are still not registered.3 The ICMJE gives guidance on acceptable registries and also accepts registration in WHO primary registries and ClinicalTrials.gov. Registers charging a fee to view their content should be avoided to ensure equity of access for everyone, including patients and the public.\nThe Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines, endorsed and used by thousands of journals, recommends trial registration.16 In a survey of 168 high impact factor medical journals’ “Instructions to authors” in 2014, 78 journals stated that all recent clinical trials must be registered as a requirement of submission to that journal.17 A more recent survey in 2019 of surgical journals publishing randomised trials found that 53 of 82 journals mandated prospective registration.18\nDespite recommendations, and mandates in some jurisdictions for clinical trialists to register their trial and evidence that registration deters selective reporting, this is still not happening universally.1920 Authors should provide the name of the registry, the trial’s associated registration number, date of registration and, where possible, the URL for the trial’s registration. We recommend that authors also report whether (or when) the trial results are available on the associated trial register.\nDespite the considerable increase in clinical trial registration, there is a strong body of evidence showing the lack of access to trial results.21–24 The latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki states that “Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human participants and are accountable for the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of their reports . . . Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly available.” In 2015, WHO published a new statement on the public disclosure of trial results, which requests that “the key outcomes are to be made publicly available within 12 months of study completion by posting to the results section of the primary clinical trial registry. Where a registry is used without a results database available, the results should be posted on a free-to-access, publicly available, searchable institutional website of the Regulatory Sponsor, Funder or Principal Investigator.” Some legislations are also in place in the US, UK, and Europe requesting the posting of trial results on clinical trials registry within 12 months after study completion.25–27\nAuthors should indicate whether the trial results are publicly posted to the trial registry, as a preprint (with URL citation) or as published articles (with citations).",

We aimed to test our hypothesis that exposure to intimate partner violence would reduce intervention effectiveness for CMDs in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).\nMethods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and who did not report intimate partner violence via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017078611.\nFindings: Of 8122 records identified, 21 were eligible and data were available for 15 RCTs, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. Anxiety (five interventions, 728 participants) showed a greater response to intervention among women reporting intimate partner violence than among those who did not (difference in standardised mean differences [dSMD] 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, I2=49.4%). No differences in response to intervention were seen in women reporting intimate partner violence for PTSD (eight interventions, n=1436; dSMD 0.14, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.33, I2=42.6%), depression (12 interventions, n=2940; 0.10, −0.04 to 0.25, I2=49.3%), and psychological distress (four interventions, n=1591; 0.07, −0.05 to 0.18, I2=0.0%, p=0.681).\nInterpretation: Psychological interventions treat anxiety effectively in women with current or recent intimate partner violence exposure in LMICs when delivered by appropriately trained and supervised health-care staff, even when not tailored for this population or targeting intimate partner violence directly. Future research should investigate whether adapting evidence-based psychological interventions for CMDs to address intimate partner violence enhances their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness in LMICs.\nFunding: UK National Institute for Health Research ASSET and King's IoPPN Clinician Investigator Scholarship.”2",

    "text": "Explanation\nAuthors typically use some criteria to decide how certain (or confident) they are in the body of evidence for each important outcome. Common factors considered include precision of the effect estimate (or sample size), consistency of findings across studies, study design limitations and missing results (risk of bias), and how directly the studies address the question. Tools and frameworks can be used to provide a systematic, explicit approach to assessing these factors and provide a common approach and terminology for communicating certainty.14 56 For example, using the GRADE approach, authors will first apply criteria to assess each GRADE domain (imprecision, inconsistency, risk of bias, and so forth) and then make an overall judgment of whether the evidence supporting a result is of high, moderate, low, or very low certainty. Reporting the factors considered and the criteria used to assess each factor enables readers to determine which factors fed into reviewers’ assessment of certainty. Reporting the process by which assessments were conducted enables readers to assess the potential for errors and facilitates replication.",

We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it related to the studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. We considered the following criteria for upgrading the certainty of evidence, if appropriate: large effect, dose-response gradient, and plausible confounding effect. We used the methods and recommendations described in sections 8.5 and 8.7, and chapters 11 and 12, of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used GRADEpro GDT software to prepare the 'Summary of findings' tables (GRADEpro GDT 2015). We justified all decisions to down- or up-grade the certainty of studies using footnotes, and we provided comments to aid the reader’s understanding of the results where necessary.”7",

They found that structured pedagogical interventions may be among the effective approaches to improve learning outcomes in low‐ and middle‐income countries. This is consistent with our findings that teacher training is only effective in improving early grade literacy outcomes when it is combined with teacher coaching. The finding is also consistent with our result that technology in education programs may have at best no effects unless they are combined with a focus on pedagogical practices. In line with our study, Snilstveit et al. (2012) also do not find evidence for statistically significant effects of the one‐laptop‐per‐child program. These results are consistent with the results of a meta‐analysis showing that technology in education programs are not effective when not accompanied by parent or student training (McEwan, 2015). However, neither Snilstveit et al. (2012) nor McEwan (2015) find evidence for negative effects of the one‐laptop‐per‐child program on early grade literacy outcomes.”1",

Effect measures refer to statistical constructs that compare outcome data between two groups. For instance, a risk ratio is an example of an effect measure that might be used for dichotomous outcomes.1 The chosen effect measure has implications for interpretation of the findings and might affect the meta-analysis results (such as heterogeneity2). Authors might use one effect measure to synthesise results and then re-express the synthesised results using another effect measure. For example, for meta-analyses of standardised mean differences, authors might re-express the combined results in units of a well known measurement scale, and for meta-analyses of risk ratios or odds ratios, authors might re-express results in absolute terms (such as risk difference).3 Furthermore, authors need to interpret effect estimates in relation to whether the effect is of importance to decision makers. For a particular outcome and effect measure, this requires specification of thresholds (or ranges) used to interpret the size of effect (such as minimally important difference; ranges for no/trivial, small, moderate, and large effects).3",

Use of face masks with or without eye protection to achieve additional protection is debated in the mainstream media and by public health authorities, in particular the use of face masks for the general population; moreover, optimum use of face masks in health-care settings, which have been used for decades for infection prevention, is facing challenges amid personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages. Any recommendations about social or physical distancing, and the use of face masks, should be based on the best available evidence. Evidence has been reviewed for other respiratory viral infections, mainly seasonal influenza, but no comprehensive review is available of information on SARS-CoV-2 or related betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We, therefore, systematically reviewed the effect of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.”4",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe validity of a synthesis may be threatened when the available results differ systematically from the missing results. This is known as “bias due to missing results” and arises from “reporting biases” such as selective non-publication and selective non-reporting of results (see item 11 – risk of bias assessment#risk-of-bias).1 Direct methods for assessing the risk of bias due to missing results include comparing outcomes and analyses pre-specified in study registers, protocols, and statistical analysis plans with results that were available in study reports. Statistical and graphical methods exist to assess whether the observed data suggest potential for missing results (such as contour enhanced funnel plots, Egger’s test) and how robust the synthesis is to different assumptions about the nature of potentially missing results (such as selection models).23 45 Tools (such as checklists, scales, or domain-based tools) that prompt users to consider some or all of these approaches are available.12 Therefore, reporting methods (tools, graphical, statistical, or other) used to assess risk of bias due to missing results is recommended so that readers are able to assess how appropriate the methods were. The process by which assessments were conducted should also be reported to enable readers to assess the potential for errors and facilitate replicability.",

Numerous tools have been developed to assess study limitations for various designs.2 However, many tools have been criticised because of their content (which may extend beyond assessing study limitations that have the potential to bias findings) and the way in which the items are combined (such as scales where items are combined to yield a numerical score) (see below).3 Reporting details of the selected tool enables readers to assess whether the tool focuses solely on items that have the potential to bias findings. Reporting details of how studies were assessed (such as by one or two authors) allows readers to assess the potential for errors in the assessments.4 Reporting how risk of bias assessments were incorporated into the analysis is addressed in Items 13e and 13f.",

    "text": "Assessment of risk of bias in studies and bias due to missing results\n\nTerminology\nThe terms “quality assessment” and “critical appraisal” are often used to describe the process of evaluating the methodological conduct or reporting of studies.2 In PRISMA 2020, we distinguish “quality” from “risk of bias” and have focused the relevant items and elaborations on the latter. Risk of bias refers to the potential for study findings to systematically deviate from the truth due to methodological flaws in the design, conduct or analysis.3 Quality is not well defined, but has been shown to encompass constructs beyond those that may bias the findings, including, for example, imprecision, reporting completeness, ethics, and applicability.56 7 In systematic reviews, focus should be given to the design, conduct, and analysis features that may lead to important bias in the findings.\n\n\nDifferent types of risk of bias\nIn PRISMA 2020, two aspects of risk of bias are considered. The first aspect is risk of bias in the results of the individual studies included in a systematic review. Empirical evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that several features of study design are associated with larger intervention effect estimates in studies; these features include inadequate generation and concealment of a random sequence to assign participants to groups, substantial loss to follow-up of participants, and unblinded outcome assessment.8\nThe second aspect is risk of bias in the result of a synthesis (such as meta-analysis) due to missing studies or results within studies. Missing studies/results may introduce bias when the decision to publish a study/result is influenced by the observed P value or magnitude or direction of the effect.9 For example, studies with statistically non-significant results may not have been submitted for publication (publication bias), or particular results that were statistically non-significant may have been omitted from study reports (selective non-reporting bias).1011\n\n\nTools for assessing risk of bias\nMany tools have been developed to assess the risk of bias in studies26 7 or bias due to missing results.12 Existing tools typically take the form of composite scales and domain-based tools.613 Composite scales include multiple items which each have a numeric score attached, from which an overall summary score might be calculated. Domain-based tools require users to judge risk of bias within specific domains, and to record the information on which each judgment was based.314 15 Specifying the components/domains in the tool used in the review can help readers determine whether the tool focuses on risk of bias only or addresses other “quality” constructs. Presenting assessments for each component/domain in the tool is preferable to reporting a single “quality score” because it enables users to understand the specific components/domains that are at risk of bias in each study.\n\n\nIncorporating assessments of risk of bias in studies into the analysis\nThe risk of bias in included studies should be considered in the presentation and interpretation of results of individual studies and syntheses. Different analytic strategies may be used to examine whether the risks of bias of the studies may influence the study results: (i) restricting the primary analysis to studies judged to be at low risk of bias (sensitivity analysis); (ii) stratifying studies according to risk of bias using subgroup analysis or meta-regression; or (iii) adjusting the result from each study in an attempt to remove the bias. Further details about each approach are available elsewhere.3",

RoB 2.0 addresses five specific domains: (1) bias arising from the randomisation process; (2) bias due to deviations from intended interventions; (3) bias due to missing outcome data; (4) bias in measurement of the outcome; and (5) bias in selection of the reported result. Two review authors independently applied the tool to each included study, and recorded supporting information and justifications for judgements of risk of bias for each domain (low; high; some concerns). Any discrepancies in judgements of risk of bias or justifications for judgements were resolved by discussion to reach consensus between the two review authors, with a third review author acting as an arbiter if necessary. Following guidance given for RoB 2.0 (Section 1.3.4) (Higgins 2016a), we derived an overall summary 'Risk of bias' judgement (low; some concerns; high) for each specific outcome, whereby the overall RoB for each study was determined by the highest RoB level in any of the domains that were assessed.”16",

    "text": "Study selection methods\nSeveral approaches to selecting studies exist. Here we comment on the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\nAssessment of each record by one reviewer: Single screening is an efficient use of time and resources, but there is a higher risk of missing relevant studies12 3\nAssessment of records by more than one reviewer: Double screening can vary from duplicate checking of all records (by two or more reviewers independently) to a second reviewer checking a sample only (for example, a random sample of screened records, or all excluded records). This approach may be more reliable than single screening but at the expense of increased reviewer time, given the time needed to resolve discrepancies12 3\nPriority screening to focus early screening effort on most relevant records: Instead of screening records in year, title, author or random order, machine learning is used to identify relevant studies earlier in the screening process than would otherwise be the case. Priority screening is an iterative process in which the machine continually reassesses unscreened records for relevance. This approach can increase review efficiency by enabling the review team to start on subsequent steps of the review while less relevant records are still being screened. Both single and multiple reviewer assessments can be combined with priority screening45\nPriority screening with the automatic elimination of less relevant records: Once the most relevant records have been identified using priority screening, teams may choose to stop screening based on the assumption that the remaining records are unlikely to be relevant. However, there is a risk of erroneously excluding relevant studies because of uncertainty about when it is safe to stop screening; the balance between efficiency gains and risk tolerance will be review-specific45\nMachine learning classifiers: Machine learning classifiers are statistical models that use training data to rank records according to their relevance. They can be calibrated to achieve a given level of recall, thus enabling reviewers to implement screening rules, such as eliminating records or replacing double with single screening. Because the performance of classifiers is highly dependent on the data used to build them, classifiers should only be used to classify records for which they are designed56\nPrevious “known” assessments: Screening decisions for records that have already been manually checked can be reused to exclude the same records from being reassessed, provided the eligibility criteria are the same. For example, groups that maintain registers of controlled trials to facilitate systematic reviews can avoid continually rescreening the same records by matching and then including/excluding those records from further consideration.\nCrowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing involves recruiting (usually via the internet) a large group of individuals to contribute to a task or project, such as screening records. If crowdsourcing is integrated with other study selection approaches, the specific platforms used should have well established and documented agreement algorithms, and data on crowd accuracy and reliability78",

The DEBATE‐ISR study compared a prospective cohort of patients receiving DEB therapy for in‐stent restenosis against a historical cohort of diabetic patients. Finally, the NCT02832024 study compared stent deployment versus atherectomy versus uncoated balloon angioplasty alone for in‐stent restenosis.”3",

These decisions will likely involve subjective judgments that could alter the result of a synthesis, yet the processes used and information to support the decisions are often absent from reviews. Reporting the processes (whether formal or informal) and any supporting information is recommended for transparency of the decisions made in grouping studies for synthesis. Structured approaches may involve the tabulation and coding of the main characteristics of the populations, interventions, and outcomes.1 For example, in a review examining the effects of psychological interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy, the main intervention component of each study was coded as one of the following based on pre-specified criteria: counselling, health education, feedback, incentive-based interventions, social support, and exercise.2 This coding provided the basis for determining which studies were eligible for each planned synthesis (such as incentive-based interventions versus usual care). Similar coding processes can be applied to populations and outcomes.",

    "text": "Explanation\nPresentation of study results using tabulation and visual display is important for transparency (particularly so for reviews or outcomes within reviews where a meta-analysis has not been undertaken) and facilitates the identification of patterns in the data. Tables may be used to present results from individual studies or from a synthesis (such as Summary of Findings table12; see item #22). The purpose of tabulating data varies but commonly includes the complete and transparent reporting of the results or comparing the results across study characteristics.3 Different purposes will likely lead to different table structures. Reporting the chosen structure(s), along with details of the data presented (such as effect estimates), can aid users in understanding the basis and rationale for the structure (such as, “Table have been structured by outcome domain, within which studies are ordered from low to high risk of bias to increase the prominence of the most trustworthy evidence.”).\nThe principal graphical method for meta-analysis is the forest plot, which displays the effect estimates and confidence intervals of each study and often the summary estimate.45 Similar to tabulation, ordering the studies in the forest plot based on study characteristics (such as by size of the effect estimate, year of publication, study weight, or overall risk of bias) rather than alphabetically (as is often done) can reveal patterns in the data.6 Other graphs that aim to display information about the magnitude or direction of effects might be considered when a forest plot cannot be used due to incompletely reported effect estimates (such as no measure of precision reported).37 Careful choice and design of graphs is required so that they effectively and accurately represent the data.4",

Albatross plots were created to provide a graphical overview of the data for interventions with more than five data points for an outcome.

Small p-values from negative associations appear at the left of the plot, small p-values from positive associations at the right, and studies with null results towards the middle. The plot allows p-values to be interpreted in the context of the study sample size; effect contours show a standardised effect size (expressed as relative risk—RR) for a given p-value and study size, providing an indication of the overall magnitude of any association. We estimated an overall magnitude of association from these contours, but this should be interpreted cautiously.”8",

First, to summarise all key information from various sections of the text using the abstract format of the intended publication or a structured summary of the background, specific problem to be addressed, methods, interventions, results, conclusions, and second, to provide adequate information to aid in searching and indexing.\nThe abstract is meant to be both descriptive, indicating the purpose, methods and scope of the initiative, and informative, including the results, conclusions and recommendations. It needs to contain sufficient information about the article to allow a reader to quickly decide if it is relevant to their work and if they wish to read the full-length article. Additionally, many online databases such as Ovid and CINAHL use abstracts to index the article so it is important to include keywords and phrases that will allow for quick retrieval in a literature search. The example given includes these.\nJournals have varying requirements for the format, content length and structure of an abstract. The above example illustrates how the important components of an abstract can be effectively incorporated in a structured abstract. It is clear that it is a healthcare improvement project. Some background information is provided, including a brief description of the setting and the participants, and the aim/objective is clearly stated. The methods section describes the strategies used for the interventions, and the results section includes data that delineates the impact of the changes. The conclusion section provides a succinct summary of the project, what led to its success and lessons learned. This abstract is descriptive and informative, allowing readers to determine whether they wish to investigate the article further.",

    "text": "Example\n\nBackground: Pain assessment documentation was inadequate because of the use of a subjective pain assessment strategy in a tertiary level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The aim of this study was to improve consistency of pain assessment documentation through implementation of a multidimensional neonatal pain and sedation assessment tool. The study was set in a 60-bed level IV NICU within an urban children’s hospital. Participants included NICU staff, including registered nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, pharmacists, neonatal fellows, and neonatologists.\nMethods: The Plan Do Study Act method of quality improvement was used for this project. Baseline assessment included review of patient medical records 6 months before the intervention. Documentation of pain assessment on admission, routine pain assessment, reassessment of pain after an elevated pain score, discussion of pain in multidisciplinary rounds, and documentation of pain assessment were reviewed. Literature review and listserv query were conducted to identify neonatal pain tools.\nIntervention: Survey of staff was conducted to evaluate knowledge of neonatal pain and also to determine current healthcare providers’ practice as related to identification and treatment of neonatal pain. A multidimensional neonatal pain tool, the Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS), was chosen by the staff for implementation.\nResults: Six months and 2 years following education on the use of the N-PASS and implementation in the NICU, a chart review of all hospitalized patients was conducted to evaluate documentation of pain assessment on admission, routine pain assessment, reassessment of pain after an elevated pain score, discussion of pain in multidisciplinary rounds, and documentation of pain assessment in the medical progress note. Documentation of pain scores improved from 60% to 100% at 6 months and remained at 99% 2 years following implementation of the N-PASS. Pain score documentation with ongoing nursing assessment improved from 55% to greater than 90% at 6 months and 2 years following the intervention. Pain assessment documentation following intervention of an elevated pain score was 0% before implementation of the N-PASS and improved slightly to 30% 6 months and 47% 2 years following implementation.\nConclusions: Identification and implementation of a multidimensional neonatal pain assessment tool, the N-PASS, improved documentation of pain in our unit. Although improvement in all quality improvement monitors was noted, additional work is needed in several key areas, specifically documentation of reassessment of pain following an intervention for an elevated pain score.\nKeywords: N-PASS, neonatal pain, pain scores, quality improvement,1",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe conclusion of a healthcare improvement paper should address the overall usefulness of the work, including its potential for dissemination and implications for the field, both in terms of practice and policy. It may be included as a separate section in or after the discussion section, or these components may be incorporated within a single overall discussion section.\nThe authors of this report highlight the usefulness of their research with reference to ‘the national(US) emphasis on reduction of readmission by payers’. They also refer throughout the paper to the debates and research around appropriate nurse staffing levels, and the impact of nurse staffing levels on the sustainability of quality improvement initiatives in general, with reference to the key role of nurses in improving care and evidence that nursing staff levels are associated with delivery of high quality care. Although the authors don’t refer directly to potential for spread to other contexts, the generalisability of their findings is discussed in a separate section of the discussion (not included here).\nIn this example, the authors refer to ‘implications for hospital administrators’ because their findings ‘suggest that hospitals might also achieve reduction in readmissions by focusing on the number of patients assigned to nurses’. They also observe that these findings speak to ‘the validity of the California minimum staffing ratio for paediatric care’. Perhaps they could have suggested more in terms of implications for policy, for example what their findings might mean for the potential of payer organisations to influence nurse staffing levels through their contracts, or for broader government legislation on nurse-patient ratios. However, in their discussion they also recognise the limitations of a single study to inform policy decisions.\nThe need for further study is emphasised in the wider discussion section. The authors note that ‘more research is needed to better understand the reasons for children’s readmissions and thus identify which ones are potentially preventable’, calling for ‘additional research on both paediatric readmission measures and the relationship between nursing care delivery, nurse staffing levels and readmissions’. In writing about healthcare improvement, it is important that the authors’ conclusions are appropriately related to their findings, reflecting their validity and generalisability, and their potential to inform practice. In this case, direct recommendations to change practice are appropriately withheld given the need for further research.",

    "text": "Example\n\nWe have found that average paediatric nurse staffing ratios are significantly associated with hospital readmission for children with common medical and surgical conditions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explicitly examine and find an association between staffing ratios and hospital readmission in paediatrics… Our findings have implications for hospital administrators given the national emphasis on reduction of readmissions by payers. The role of nursing care in reducing readmissions has traditionally focused on nurse-led discharge planning programmes in the inpatient setting and nurse-directed home care for patients with complex or chronic conditions.\nWhile these nurse-oriented interventions have been shown to significantly reduce readmissions, our findings suggest that hospitals might also achieve reductions in readmission by focusing on the number of patients assigned to nurses. In paediatrics, limiting nurses’ workloads to four or fewer patients appears to have benefits in reducing readmissions.\nFurther, hospitals are earnestly examining their discharge processes and implementing quality improvement programmes aimed at preparing patients and families to manage health condition(s) beyond the hospital. Quality improvement initiatives to improve inpatient care delivery often depend upon the sustained efforts of front-line workers, particularly nurses. Prior research shows that hospitals with better nurse staffing ratios deliver Joint Commission-recommended care for key conditions more reliably, highlighting the inter-relationship of nurse staffing levels and quality improvement success.\nThe sustainability of quality improvement initiatives related to paediatric readmission may ultimately depend on nurses’ ability to direct meaningful time and attention to such efforts.1",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nContext is known to affect the process and outcome of interventions to improve the quality of healthcare.1 This section of a report should describe the contextual factors that authors considered important at the outset of the improvement initiative. The goal of including information on context is twofold. First, describing the context in which the initiative took place is necessary to assist readers in understanding whether the intervention is likely to ‘work’ in their local environment, and, more broadly, the generalisability of the finding. Second, it enables the researchers to examine the role of context as a moderator of successful intervention(s). Specific and relevant elements of context thought to optimise the likelihood of success should be addressed in the design of the intervention, and plans should be made a priori to measure these factors and examine how they interact with the success of the intervention.\nDescribing the context within the methods section orients the reader to where the initiative occurred. In single-centre studies, this description usually includes information about the location, patient population, size, staffing, practice type, teaching status, system affiliation and relevant processes in place at the start of the intervention, as is demonstrated in the first example by Dandoy et al2 reporting a QI effort to reduce monitor alarms. Similar information is also provided in aggregate for multicentre studies. In the second example by Duncan et al,3 a table is used to describe the practice characteristics of the 21 participating paediatric primary care practices, and includes information on practice type, practice setting, practice size, patient characteristics and use of an electronic health record. This information can be used by the reader to assess whether his or her own practice setting is similar enough to the practices included in this report to enable extrapolation of the results. The authors state that they selected practices to achieve diversity in these key contextual factors. This was likely done so that the team could assess the effectiveness of the interventions in a range of settings and increase the generalisability of the findings.\nAny contextual factors believed a priori would impact the success of their intervention should be specifically discussed in this section. Although the authors’ rationale is not explicitly stated, the example suggests that they had specific hypotheses about key aspects of a practice’s context that would impact implementation of the interventions. They addressed these contextual factors in the design of their study in order to increase the likelihood that the intervention would be successful. For example, they stated specifically that they selected practices with previous healthcare improvement experience and strong physician leadership. In addition, the authors noted that practices were recruited through an existing research consortium, indicating their belief that project sponsorship by an established external network could impact success of the initiative. They also noted that practices were made aware that American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification Part 4 credit had been applied for but not assured, implying that the authors believed incentives could impact project success. While addressing context in the design of the intervention may increase the likelihood of success, these choices limit the generalisability of the findings to other similar practices with prior healthcare improvement experience, strong physician leadership and available incentives.\nThis example could have been strengthened by using a published framework such as the Model for Understanding Success in Quality (MUSIQ),4 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR),1or the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) model5 to identify the subset of relevant contextual factors that would be examined.4,6 The use of such frameworks is not a requirement but a helpful option for approaching the issue of context. The relevance of any particular framework can be determined by authors based on the focus of their work—MUSIQ was developed specifically for microsystem or organisational QI efforts, whereas CFIR and PARiHS were developed more broadly to examine implementation of evidence or other innovations.\nIf elements of context are hypothesised to be important, but are not going to be addressed specifically in the design of the intervention, plans to measure these contextual factors prospectively should be made during the study design phase. In these cases, measurement of contextual factors should be clearly described in the methods section, data about how contextual factors interacted with the interventions should be included in the results section, and the implications of these findings should be explored in the discussion. For example, if the authors of the examples below had chosen this approach, they would have measured participating team’s’ prior healthcare improvement experience and looked for differences in successful implementation based on whether practices had prior experience or not. In cases where context was not addressed prospectively, authors are still encouraged to explore the impact of context on the results of intervention(s) in the discussion section.",

    "text": "Explanation\nHealthcare improvement work is based on a rationale, or hypothesis, as to what intervention will have the desired outcome(s) in a given context. Over time, as a result of the interaction between interventions and context, these hypotheses are re-evaluated, resulting in modifications or changes to the interventions. Although the mechanism by which this occurs should be included in the methods section of a report, the resulting transformation of the intervention over time rightfully belongs under results. The results section should therefore describe both this evolution and its associated outcomes.\nWhen publishing this work, it is important that the reader has specific information about the initial interventions and how they evolved. This can be in the form of tables and figures in addition to text. In the example below, interventions are described in phases: I, II, III and a sustainability phase, and information provided as to why they evolved and how various roles were impacted (Figure 2). This level of detail allows readers to imagine how these interventions and staff roles might be adapted in the context of their own institutions, as an intervention which is successful in one organisation may not be in another.\nIt is important to report the degree of success achieved in implementing an intervention in order to assess its fidelity, for example, the proportion of the time that the intervention actually occurred as intended. In the example below, the goal of delivering antibiotics within an hour of arrival, a process measure, is expressed in terms of the percentage of total patients for whom it was achieved. The first chart (Figure 3) shows the sustained improvement in this measure over time. The second chart (Figure 1) illustrates the resulting decrease in variation as the interventions evolved and took hold. The charts are annotated to show the phases of evolution of the project, to enable readers to see where each intervention fits in relationship to project results over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Statistical process control chart showing time to administration of antibiotics, with annotation (adapted from Jobson et al1 (n.d.ak))",

During phase I, the existing processes for identifying and managing febrile patients with central lines were mapped and analyzed. Key interventions that were tested and implemented included revision of the greeter role to include identification of patients with central lines presenting with fever and notification of the triage nurse, designation of chief complaint as “fever/central line,” re-education and re-emphasis of triage acuity as 2 for these patients, and routine stocking of the Pyxis machine ….\nIn phase II, strategies focused on improving performance by providing data and other information for learning, using a monthly newsletter, public sharing of aggregate compliance data tracking, individual reports of personal performance, personal coaching of noncompliant staff, and rewards for compliance…\nIn phase III, a management guideline with key decision elements was developed and implemented (Figure 3). A new patient identification and initial management process was designed based on the steps, weaknesses, and challenges identified in the existing process map developed in phase I.

    "text": "Explanation\nThe limitations section offers an opportunity to present potential weaknesses of the study, explain the choice of methods, measures and intervention, and examine why results may not be generalisable beyond the context in which the work occurred. In the first example, a study of family activated METs, Brady et al identified a number of issues that might influence internal validity and the extent to which their findings are generalisable to other hospitals. The success of METs, and the participation of family members in calling these teams, may depend on contextual attributes such as leadership involvement. Although few hospitals have implemented family activated METs, the growing interest in patient and family engagement may also contribute to a broader use of this intervention. There are no data available to assess the secular trends in these practices that might suggest the observed changes resulted from external factors.\nThere were few family activated MET calls. This positive result may stem from family education, but the authors report that they had limited data on such education. The lack of a validated tool to capture chart review information is noted as a potential weakness since some non-clinical MET calls might not have been recorded in the chart. The authors also note that the observed levels of family activated MET calls are consistent with other literature.\nThe impact of improvement interventions often varies with context, but the large number of potential factors to consider requires that researchers focus on a limited set of contextual measures they believe may influence success and future adaptation and spread. In the second example given, Dixon-Woods et al assessed variation in results of the implementation of the central line bundle to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections in English ICUs.1 While English units made improvements, the results were not as impressive as in the earlier US experience. The researchers point to the prior experiences of staff in the English ICUs in several infection control campaigns, as contributing to this difference. Many English clinicians viewed the new programme as redundant, believing this was a problem already solved. The research team also notes that some of the English ICUs did not have an organisational culture that supported consistent implementation of the required changes.\nDixon-Woods et al relied on quantitative data on clinical outcomes as well as observation and qualitative interviews with staff. However, as they report, their study had several limitations. Their visits to the units were not longitudinal, so changes could have been made in some units after the researchers’ observations. They did not carry out systematic audits of culture and practices that might have revealed additional information, nor did they assess the impact of local factors including the size of the unit, the number of doctors and nurses, and other factors that might have affected the capability of the unit to implement new practices. Moreover, while the study included controls, there was considerable public and professional interest in these issues, which may have influenced performance and reduced the relative impact of the intervention. The authors’ report1 of the context and limitations is crucial to assist the reader in assessing their results, and in identifying factors that might influence results of similar interventions elsewhere.",

    "text": "Examples\n\nExample 1\n\nOur study had several limitations. Our study of family MET activations compared performance with our historical controls, and we were unable to adjust for secular trends or unmeasured confounders. Our improvement team included leaders of our MET committee and patient safety, and we are not aware of any ongoing improvement work or systems change that might have affected family MET calls. We performed our interventions in a large tertiary care children’s hospital with a history of improvement in patient safety and patient-centred and family-centred care.\nAdditionally, it is uncertain and likely very context-dependent as to what is the ‘correct’ level of family-activated METs. This may limit generalizability to other centres, although the consistently low rate of family MET calls in the literature in a variety of contexts should reduce concerns related to responding team workload. We do not have process measures of how often MET education occurred for families and of how often families understood this information or felt empowered to call. This results in a limited understanding of the next best steps to improve family calling. Our data were collected in the course of clinical care with chart abstraction from structured clinical notes. Given this, it is possible that notes were not written for family MET calls that were judged ‘nonclinical.’ From our knowledge of the MET system, we are confident such calls are quite few, but we lack the data to quantify this. Our chart review for the reasons families called did not use a validated classification tool as we do not believe one exists. This is somewhat mitigated by our double independent reviews that demonstrated the reliability of our classification scheme.2\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\nOur study has a number of important limitations. Our ethnographic visits to units were not longitudinal, but rather snapshots in time; changes in response to the program could have occurred after our visits. We did not conduct a systematic audit of culture and practices, and thus some inaccuracies in our assessments may be present. We did not evaluate possible modifiers of effect of factors such as size of unit, number of consultants and nurses, and other environmental features. We had access to ICUs’ reported infection rates only if they provided them directly to us; for information governance reasons, these rates could not be verified. It is possible that we have offered too pessimistic an interpretation of whether Matching Michigan ‘worked’: the quantitative evaluation may have underestimated the effects of the program (or over-estimated the secular trend), since the ‘waiting’ clusters were not true controls that were unexposed to the interventions. …1",

Efforts made by the team to recover the data should be described, and any available details about the missing data provided.\nIn the first example,1 the improvement team was unable to contact 56 patients for phone or email follow-up (ie, why the data are missing). To account for this missing data, the team performed serial reviews of medical records. In doing so, they were able to report patient information relevant to the study outcomes. In the second example,2 the authors also clearly state the reasons for missing data (failure to recover outside records, transfers of care, unreachable by phone or email). In addition, they give details about the number of outreach attempts made for specific patient groups.

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe label ‘rationale’ for this guideline item refers to the reasons the authors have for expecting that an intervention will ‘work.’ A rationale is always present in the heads of researchers; however, it is important to make this explicit and communicate it in healthcare quality improvement work. Without this, learning from empirical studies may be limited and opportunities for accumulating and synthesising knowledge across studies restricted.1\nAuthors can express a rationale in a variety of ways, and in more than one way in a specific paper. These include providing an explanation, specifying underlying principles, hypothesising processes or mechanism of change, or producing a logic model (often in the form of a diagram) or a programme theory. The rationale may draw on a specific theory with clear causal links between constructs or on a general framework which indicates potential mechanisms of change that an intervention could target.\nA well developed rationale allows the possibility of evaluating not just whether the intervention had an effect, but how it had that effect. This provides a basis for understanding the mechanisms of action of the intervention, and how it is likely to vary across, for example, populations, settings and targets. An explicit rationale leads to specific hypotheses about mechanisms and/or variation, and testing these hypotheses provides valuable new knowledge, whether or not they are supported. This knowledge lays the foundation for optimising the intervention, accumulating evidence about mechanisms and variation, and advancing theoretical understanding of interventions in general.\nThe first example shows how a theory (the ‘Fit between Individuals, Task and Technology’ framework) can identify and clarify the social and technological barriers to healthcare improvement work. The study investigated engagement with a computerised system to support decisions about postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: use of the framework led to 11 distinct barriers being identified, each associated with a clearly specified intervention which was undertaken.\nThe second example illustrates the use of an integrative theoretical framework for intervention development.2 The authors used an integrative framework rather than a specific theory/model/framework. This was in order to start with as comprehensive a framework as possible, since many theories of behaviour change are partial. This example provides a clear description of the framework and how analysing the target behaviour using an integrative theoretical model informed the selection of intervention content.\nInterventions may be effective without the effects being brought about by changes identified in the hypothesised mechanisms; on the other hand, they may activate the hypothesised mechanisms without changing behaviour. The knowledge gained through a theory-based evaluation is essential for understanding processes of change and, hence, for developing more effective interventions. This paper also cited evidence for, and examples of, the utility of the framework in other contexts.",

At each step of collection, we categorised data according to the FITT (‘Fit between Individuals, Task, and Technology’)model criteria … Each component of the activity system (ie, user, task and technology) was clearly defined and each interface between components was explored by drawing from several epistemological disciplines including the social and cognitive sciences. The team designed interventions to address each identified FITT barrier……. By striving to understand the barriers affecting activity system components and the interfaces between them, we were able to develop a plan that addressed user needs, implement an intervention that articulated with workflow, study the contextual determinants of performance, and act in alignment with stakeholder expectations.3\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n…We describe the development of an intervention to improve medication management in multimorbidity by general practitioners (GPs), in which we applied the steps of the BCW(Behaviour Change Wheel)4 to enable a more transparent implementation of the MRC (Medical Research Council) framework for design and evaluation of complex interventions….\n…we used the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation—behaviour) model to develop a theoretical understanding of the target behaviour and guide our choice of intervention functions. We used the COM-B model to frame our qualitative behavioural analysis of the qualitative synthesis and interview data. We coded empirical data relevant to GPs’ …capabilities, …opportunities and …motivations to highlight why GPs were or were not engaging in the target behaviour and what needed to change for the target behaviour to be achieved.\nThe BCW incorporates a comprehensive panel of nine intervention functions, shown in Figure 1, which were drawn from a synthesis of 19 frameworks of behavioural-intervention strategies. We determined which intervention functions would be most likely to effect behavioural change in our intervention by mapping the individual components of the COM-B behavioural analysis onto the published BCW linkage matrices…5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Behaviour change wheel (adapted from Sinnott et al (n.d.p)5 and Mitchie et al.2 (n.d.q)",

    "text": "Explanation\nBroadly, the study of the intervention is the reflection upon the work that was done, its effects on the systems and people involved, and an assessment of the internal and external validity of the intervention. Addressing this item will be greatly facilitated by the presence of a strong rationale, because when authors are clear about why they thought an intervention should work, the path to assessing the what, when, why and how of success or failure becomes easier.\nThe study of the intervention may at least partly (but not only) be accomplished through the study design used. For example, a stepped wedge design or comparison control group can be used to study the effects of the intervention. Other examples of ways to study the intervention include, but are not limited to, stakeholder satisfaction surveys around the intervention, focus groups or interviews with involved personnel, evaluations of the fidelity of implementation of an intervention, or estimation of unintended effects through specific analyses. . The aims and methods for this portion of the work should be clearly specified. The authors should indicate whether these evaluative techniques were performed by the authors themselves, or an outside team, and what the relationship was between the authors and the evaluators. The timing of the ‘study of the intervention’ activities relative to the intervention should be indicated.\nIn the first example,1 the cross-functional team study, the goal was to improve utilisation of operating room time by having a multidisciplinary, interprofessional group proactively manage the operating room schedule. This project used a prespecified study design to study an intervention, including an intervention and a control group. They assessed whether the observed outcomes were due to the intervention or some other cause (internal validity) by comparing operating room utilisation over time at the intervention site to utilisation at the control site. They understood the possible confounding effects of system-wide changes to operating room policies, and planned their analysis to account for this by using a quasi-experimental time series design. The authors used statistical results to determine the validity of their findings, suggesting that the decrease in variation in use was indicative of organisational learning.\nIn a subsequent section of this report, the authors also outlined an evaluation they performed to make sure that improved efficiency of operating room was not associated with adverse changes in operative mortality or complication rates. This is an example of how an assessment of unintended impact of the intervention—an important component of studying the intervention—might be completed. An additional way to assess impact in this particular study might have been to obtain information from staff on their impressions of the programme, or to assess how cross-functional teams were implemented at this particular site.\nIn the second example,2 a programme to improve the transition from paediatric to adult cystic fibrosis care was implemented and evaluated. The authors used a robust theoretical framework to help develop their work in this area, and its presence supported their evaluative design by showing whose feedback would be needed in order to determine success: healthcare providers, patients and their families. In this paper, the development of the intervention incorporated the principle of studying it through PDSA cycles, which were briefly reported to give the reader a sense of the validity of the intervention. Outcomes of the intervention were assessed by testing how patients’ physical parameters changed over time before and after the intervention. To test whether these changes were likely to be related to the implementation of the new transition programme, patients and families were asked to complete a survey, which demonstrated the overall utility of the intervention to the target audience of families and patients. The survey also helped support the assertion that the intervention was the reason patient outcomes improved by testing whether people actually used the intervention materials as intended.",

    "text": "Ready to get started?\nDownload resources\n\n\n\nResearch Paradigm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstruments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData collection instruments include (but are not limited to) interview or focus group guides, observational protocols and prompts for field notes, and data extraction or coding protocols for selection and analysis of documents, photographs, videos, or other artifacts”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA term drawn from quantitative research, bias technically means a systematic error, where a particular research finding deviates from a ‘true’ finding. This might come about through errors in the manner of interviewing, or by errors in sampling. In qualitative research this is a problematic concept, since by definition the qualitative researcher is part of the process, and all researchers are different. This human factor has been said to be both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of qualitative method. What can be done in commercial qualitative research, however, is to minimise obvious and avoidable sources of bias, for example by not confining all the fieldwork to one social group or geographic location, by taking steps to recognise the personal views of the researcher, (using techniques such as bracketing), and by working in teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of purposeful (or purposive) sampling.\n\n\nPurposeful sampling means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question.\n\n\nOther sampling techniques, such as theoretical sampling (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), snowball sampling (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and convenience sampling (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA qualitative “approach” is a general way of thinking about conducting qualitative research. It describes, either explicitly or implicitly, the purpose of the qualitative research, the role of the researcher(s), the stages of research, and the method of data analysis. Commonly used approaches include ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, and narrative research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). Data collection methods include (but are not limited to) interviews, focus groups, observations (direct or indirect via video), and review of written text, photographs, and other documents or materials. See {{&lt; meta items.data-collection-instruments.title &gt;}} for triangulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIterative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start and end dates for data collection and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scientific description of peoples and cultures with their customs, habits, and mutual differences.\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrounded theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA method consisting of a set of systematic, but flexible, guidelines for conducting inductive qualitative inquiry aimed toward theory construction. This method focuses squarely on the analytic phases of research, although both data collection and analysis inform and shape each other and are conducted in tandem.\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree of participation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if some participants were observed and interviewed and others only interviewed, or if some participants completed multiple interviews and others completed a single interview, these variations should be explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit of analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexivity refers to intentional, systematic consideration of the potential or actual effects of the researcher(s) on all aspects of the study process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transferability of a research finding is the extent to which it can be applied in other contexts and studies. It is thus equivalent to or a replacement for the terms generalizability and external validity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralizability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appropriate scope for generalization of the findings beyond the study (e.g., to other settings, populations, time periods, circumstances)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic findings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic findings may include interpretations, inferences, narratives, themes, and models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency of specific themes or codes.",

Recruitment stopped when saturation was reached (no new themes were identified). The team systematically reviewed the themes and sorted them into content domains. The team used an analytic matrix to identify patterns and connections amongst the domains. Two of us not involved in the qualitative coding process (R.E., M.K.) audited the analytic matrix, choice of quotes, and thematic analysis.\n\n\nThe analysis started after the first interview. All data were analyzed with the aid of the audio- coding facility of the NVivo 8: QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Vic, Australia programme. First, [name] and [name] coded independently from one another, making sure to stay semantically close to the participants’ wording. Then we discussed these open codes and defined axial codes.[REF] New insights about the impact of CST were written down in memos.\n\n\nVideotapes were analysed using immersion/crystallisation methods of qualitative data analysis.[REF] With no pre-existing framework developed in advance for analysis, an inductive approach was used to discover patterns of NVB in the data. A team of six researchers met weekly for 18 months to view videos together. Using a consensus-building approach based on a combination of field notes, ‘opportunistic’ interviews with the participants, and repeated viewing of the same material, sometimes many months apart, we eventually achieved consensus on verbal, non-verbal, and physical themes and patterns observed in the data. Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit,’ we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\n\n\nAll transcripts were coded thematically by four of the five authors, who met regularly to identify areas of convergence until full agreement was reached. One of the interviewers (P.M.) maintained an audit trail to track the team’s developing thinking. A process of dialectical empiricism[REF] was used to categorise the emergent themes into more abstract concepts…",

Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).",

    "text": "Examples\n\nWe identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.\n\n\nBecause our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.\n\n\nTheir three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance). In each of these areas, medical enculturation was achieved by two overlapping processes, ‘absorption’ and ‘assimilation’, each of which may have distinct implications for postgraduate medical education.",

    "text": "Commonly used techniques\nTechniques to enhance trustworthiness will depend on the paradigm, approach, and/or methods used. Commonly used techniques include: member checking; triangulation of data sources, methods, and/or researchers; creation of an explicit audit trail; and immersion in the site of data collection for an extended period of time (especially for research in which an observer’s presence is likely to disrupt the phenomenon under investigation). Member checking involves sharing findings, such as descriptions of key phenomena, themes, or an explanatory model, with participants and asking them to verify the accuracy or resonance with their perspectives. Triangulation involves using more than one data source, method, or researcher to add diverse perspectives on the findings of the study and, in some approaches, to test the transferability or generalizability of a model. An audit trail involves careful documentation of all decisions made throughout the study, from initial conceptualization to study design, sampling, analysis, and reporting, to provide transparency and to enable an external researcher to review all the steps involved in the study.",

Triangulation with the focus group data allowed us to broaden the in-depth information from the interviews in the analysis and to ‘share and compare’ this with information from students and doctors with varying levels of CST (no, limited, full programme) and from two universities (Universities of Antwerp and Ghent). Moreover, this enabled us to better explore the evolution over time, given that the focus groups included participants at different stages of their study: before clerkships (year 4, undergraduate), during clerkships (year 6, undergraduate), after clerkships (year 7, undergraduate) and postgraduate (general practice trainees, and supervising specialists and GPs; Table 1). &gt; &gt; Finally, as a test of ‘goodness-of-fit’, we carefully reviewed the videotapes for any ‘deviant’ cases that did not fit the categories we had developed.\nTriangulation of Researchers + Audit trail &gt; To ensure rigor and increase authenticity in our methodology, we used two kinds of triangulation—investigator triangulation and data triangulation.[REF] We sought analytical rigor using an audit trail and multiple coders; our coding team included an experienced clinician (M.G.) as well as a nonclinician with expertise in medical communication and team dynamics (L.L.).",

Actual application of a test in clinical practice will not just be guided by the test's accuracy, but by several other dimensions as well, including feasibility and safety. This also applies to the reference standard.\nIn the example, the authors distinguished between ‘significant’ and ‘minor’ adverse events, and explicitly reported how often these were observed.",

    "text": "Explanation\nIn the introduction of scientific study reports, authors should describe the rationale for their study. In doing so, they can refer to previous work on the topic, remaining uncertainty and the clinical implications of this knowledge gap. To help readers in evaluating the implications of the study, authors can clarify the intended use and the clinical role of the test under evaluation, which is referred to as the index test.\nThe intended use of a test can be diagnosis, screening, staging, monitoring, surveillance, prognosis, treatment selection or other purposes.1 The clinical role of the test under evaluation refers to its anticipated position relative to other tests in the clinical pathway.2 A triage test, for example, will be used before an existing test because it is less costly or burdensome, but often less accurate as well. An add-on test will be used after existing tests, to improve the accuracy of the total test strategy by identifying false positives or false negatives of the initial test. In other cases, a new test may be used to replace an existing test.\nDefining the intended use and clinical role of the test will guide the design of the study and the targeted level of sensitivity and specificity; from these definitions follow the eligibility criteria, how and where to identify eligible participants, how to perform tests and how to interpret test results.2\nSpecifying the clinical role is helpful in assessing the relative importance of potential errors (false positives and false negatives) made by the index test. A triage test to rule out disease, for example, will need very high sensitivity, whereas the one that mainly aims to rule in disease will need very high specificity.\nIn the example, the intended use is diagnosis of knee fractures in patients with acute knee injuries, and the potential clinical role is triage test; radiography, the existing test, would only be performed in those with a positive outcome of the newly developed decision rule. The authors outline the current scientific and clinical background of the health problem studied, and their reason for aiming to develop a triage test: this would reduce the number of radiographs and, consequently, healthcare costs.",

Many retrospective studies include participants based on searching hospital databases for patients that underwent the index test and the reference standard.2\nDifferences in methods for identifying eligible patients can affect the spectrum and prevalence of the target condition in the study group, as well as the range and relative frequency of alternative conditions in patients without the target condition.3 These differences can influence the estimates of diagnostic accuracy.\nIn the example, participants were identified through searching a patient database and were included if they underwent the index test and the reference standard.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIndeterminate results refer to those that are neither positive or negative.1 Such results can occur on the index test and the reference standard, and are a challenge when evaluating the performance of a diagnostic test.1 The occurrence of indeterminate test results varies from test to test, but frequencies up to 40% have been reported.2\nThere are many underlying causes for indeterminate test results.23 A test may fail because of technical reasons or an insufficient sample, for example, in the absence of cells in a needle biopsy from a tumour.4–6 Sometimes test results are not reported as just positive or negative, as in the case of ventilation–perfusion scanning in suspected pulmonary embolism, where the findings are classified in three categories: normal, high probability or inconclusive.7\nIn itself, the frequency of indeterminate test results is an important indicator of the feasibility of the test, and typically limits the overall clinical usefulness; therefore, authors are encouraged to always report the respective frequencies with reasons, as well as failures to complete the testing procedure. This applies to the index test and the reference standard.\nIgnoring indeterminate test results can produce biased estimates of accuracy, if these results do not occur at random. Clinical practice may guide the decision on how to handle indeterminate results.\nThere are multiple ways for handling indeterminate test results in the analysis when estimating accuracy and expressing test performance.3 They can be ignored altogether, be reported but not accounted for or handled as a separate test result category. Handling these results as a separate category may be useful when indeterminate results occur more often, for example, in those without the target condition than in those with the target condition. It is also possible to reclassify all such results: as false positives or false negatives, depending on the reference standard result (‘worst-case scenario’), or as true positives and true negatives (‘best-case scenario’).\nIn the example, the authors explicitly chose a conservative approach by considering all indeterminate results from the index test as being false-negative (in those with the target condition) or false-positive (in all others), a strategy sometimes referred to as the ‘worst-case scenario’.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nTest results in their original form can be dichotomous (positive vs negative), have multiple categories (as in high, intermediate or low risk) or be continuous (interval or ratio scale).\nFor tests with multiple categories, or continuous results, the outcomes from testing are often reclassified into positive (disease confirmed) and negative (disease excluded). This is performed by defining a threshold: the test positivity cut-off. Results that exceed the threshold would then be called positive index test results. In other studies, an ROC curve is derived, by calculating the sensitivity–specificity pairs for all possible cut-offs.\nTo evaluate the validity and applicability of these classifications, readers would like to know these positivity cut-offs or result categories, how they were determined and whether they were defined prior to the study or after collecting the data. Prespecified thresholds can be based on (1) previous studies, (2) cut-offs used in clinical practice, (3) thresholds recommended by clinical practice guidelines or (4) thresholds recommended by the manufacturer. If no such thresholds exist, the authors may be tempted to explore the accuracy for various thresholds after the data have been collected.\nIf the authors selected the positivity cut-off after performing the test, choosing the one that maximised test performance, there is an increased risk that the resulting accuracy estimates are overly optimistic, especially in small studies.1,2 Subsequent studies may fail to replicate the findings.3,4\nIn the example, the authors stated the rationale for their selection of cut-offs.",

    "text": "Explanation\nSome medical tests, such as most forms of imaging, require human handling, interpretation and judgement. These actions may be influenced by the information that is available to the reader.23,4 This can lead to artificially high agreement between tests, or between the index test and the reference standard.\nIf the reader of a test has access to information about signs, symptoms and previous test results, the reading may be influenced by this additional information, but this may still represent how the test is used in clinical practice.5 The reverse may also apply, if the reader does not have enough information for a proper interpretation of the index test outcome. In that case, test performance may be affected downwards, and the study findings may have limited applicability. Either way, readers of the study report should know to which extent, such additional information was available to test readers and may have influenced their final judgement.\nIn other situations, the assessors of the reference standard may have had access to the index test results. In those cases, the final classification may be guided by the index test result, and the reported accuracy estimates for the index test will be too high.2,56 Tests that require subjective interpretation are particularly susceptible to this bias.\nWithholding information from the readers of the test is commonly referred to as ‘blinding’ or ‘masking’. The point of this reporting item is not that blinding is desirable or undesirable, but, rather, that readers of the study report need information about blinding for the index test and the reference standard to be able to interpret the study findings.\nIn the example, the readers of unenhanced CT for differentiating between renal angiomyolipoma and renal cell carcinoma did not have access to clinical information, nor to the results of histopathology, the reference standard in this study.",

    "text": "Explanation\nLike other clinical trials and studies, diagnostic accuracy studies are at risk of bias; they can generate estimates of the test's accuracy that do not reflect the true performance of the test, due to flaws or deficiencies in study design and analysis.1,2 In addition, imprecise accuracy estimates, with wide CIs, should be interpreted with caution. Because of differences in design, participants and procedures, the findings generated by one particular diagnostic accuracy study may not be obtained in other conditions; their generalisability may be limited.3\nIn the Discussion section, authors should critically reflect on the validity of their findings, address potential limitations and elaborate on why study findings may or may not be generalisable. As bias can come down to overestimation or underestimation of the accuracy of the index test under investigation, authors should discuss the direction of potential bias, along with its likely magnitude. Readers are then informed of the likelihood that the limitations jeopardise the study's results and conclusions (see also Item 27).4\nSome journals explicitly encourage authors to report on study limitations, but many are not specific about which elements should be addressed.5 For diagnostic accuracy studies, we highly recommend that at least potential sources of bias are discussed, as well as imprecision, and concerns related to the selection of patients and the setting in which the study was performed.\nIn the example, the authors identified two potential sources of bias that are common in diagnostic accuracy studies: not all test results were verified by the reference standard, and there was a time interval between index test and reference standard, allowing the target condition to change. They also discussed the magnitude of this potential bias, and the direction: whether this may have led to overestimations or underestimations of test accuracy.",

Second, there was a long time interval between CTC and the reference methods in some patients, predominately those with negative CTC findings.

In those cases, hypotheses generally include a quantitative expression of the expected value of the diagnostic parameter. In other cases, statistical hypotheses are defined in terms of equality or non-inferiority in accuracy when comparing two or more index tests.\nA priori specification of the study hypotheses limits the chances of post hoc data-dredging with spurious findings, premature conclusions about the performance of tests or subjective judgement about the accuracy of the test. Objectives and hypotheses also guide sample size calculations. An evaluation of 126 reports of diagnostic test accuracy studies published in high-impact journals in 2010 revealed that 88% did not state a clear hypothesis.1\nIn the first example, the authors' objective was to evaluate the accuracy of three diagnostic strategies; their specific hypothesis was that the sensitivity of any of these would exceed the prespecified value of 95%. In the second example, the authors explicitly describe the hypotheses they want to explore in their study. The first hypothesis is about the comparative sensitivity of two index tests (rapid antigen detection test vs culture performed in physician office laboratories); the second is about variability of rapid test performance according to patient characteristics (spectrum bias).",

Trial registration also allows reviewers to identify studies that have been completed but were not yet reported.\nMany journals require registration of clinical trials. A low but increasing number of diagnostic accuracy studies are also being registered. In a recent evaluation of 351 test accuracy studies published in high-impact journals in 2012, 15% had been registered.2\nIncluding a registration number in the study report facilitates identification of the trial in the corresponding registry.

We believe it is therefore necessary to describe clearly whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed, or afterwards. If authors define the study question before index test and reference standards are performed, they can take appropriate actions for optimising procedures according to the study protocol and for dedicated data collection.1\nSometimes, the idea for a study originates when patients have already undergone the index test and the reference standard. If so, data collection relies on reviewing patient charts or extracting data from registries. Though such retrospective studies can sometimes reflect routine clinical practice better than prospective studies, they may fail to identify all eligible patients, and often result in data of lower quality, with more missing data points.1 A reason for this could be, for example, that in daily clinical practice, not all patients undergoing the index test may proceed to have the reference standard.\nIn the example, the data were clearly collected retrospectively: participants were identified through database screening, clinical data were abstracted from patients' medical records, though images were reinterpreted.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe relative proportion of false-positive or false-negative results of a diagnostic test may vary depending on patient characteristics, experience of readers, the setting and previous test results.1,2 Researchers may therefore want to explore possible sources of variability in test accuracy within their study. In such analyses, investigators typically assess differences in accuracy across subgroups of participants, readers or centres.\nPost hoc analyses, performed after looking at the data, carry a high risk for spurious findings. The results are especially likely not to be confirmed by subsequent studies. Analyses that were prespecified in the protocol, before data were collected, have greater credibility.3\nIn the example, the authors reported that the accuracy of the urinary indices was evaluated in two subgroups that were explicitly prespecified.",

    "text": "Example\n\n‘To assess the performance of urinary indices or their changes over the first 24 hours in distinguishing transient AKI [acute kidney injury] from persistent AKI, we plotted the receiver-operating characteristic curves for the proportion of true positives against the proportion of false positives, depending on the prediction rule used to classify patients as having persistent AKI. The same strategy was used to assess the performance of indices and their changes over time in two predefined patient subgroups; namely, patients who did not receive diuretic therapy and patients without sepsis’.4",

Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient’s HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005.\nResults: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379,872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22,744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2,689,287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age.\nLimitations: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years.\nConclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era. However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reduce mortality rates for these persons compared with the general population.5",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nBiased studies produce results that differ systematically from the truth (see below). It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example1. Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example2. Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible “drift” in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.\nUnfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles3. A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in three psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias4. A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results5.\n\nBias\nBias is a systematic deviation of a study’s result from a true value. Typically, it is introduced during the design or implementation of a study and cannot be remedied later. Bias and confounding are not synonymous. Bias arises from flawed information or subject selection so that a wrong association is found. Confounding produces relations that are factually right, but that cannot be interpreted causally because some underlying, unaccounted for factor is associated with both exposure and outcome (see 12a. Statistical methods). Also, bias needs to be distinguished from random error, a deviation from a true value caused by statistical fluctuations (in either direction) in the measured data. Many possible sources of bias have been described and a variety of terms are used6,7. We find two simple categories helpful: information bias and selection bias.\nInformation bias occurs when systematic differences in the completeness or the accuracy of data lead to differential misclassification of individuals regarding exposures or outcomes. For instance, if diabetic women receive more regular and thorough eye examinations, the ascertainment of glaucoma will be more complete than in women without diabetes (see 9. Bias)2. Patients receiving a drug that causes non-specific stomach discomfort may undergo gastroscopy more often and have more ulcers detected than patients not receiving the drug – even if the drug does not cause more ulcers. This type of information bias is also called ‘detection bias’ or ‘medical surveillance bias’. One way to assess its influence is to measure the intensity of medical surveillance in the different study groups, and to adjust for it in statistical analyses. In case-control studies information bias occurs if cases recall past exposures more or less accurately than controls without that disease, or if they are more or less willing to report them (also called ‘recall bias’). ‘Interviewer bias’ can occur if interviewers are aware of the study hypothesis and subconsciously or consciously gather data selectively8. Some form of blinding of study participants and researchers is therefore often valuable.\nSelection bias may be introduced in case-control studies if the probability of including cases or controls is associated with exposure. For instance, a doctor recruiting participants for a study on deep-vein thrombosis might diagnose this disease in a woman who has leg complaints and takes oral contraceptives. But she might not diagnose deep-vein thrombosis in a woman with similar complaints who is not taking such medication. Such bias may be countered by using cases and controls that were referred in the same way to the diagnostic service9. Similarly, the use of disease registers may introduce selection bias: if a possible relationship between an exposure and a disease is known, cases may be more likely to be submitted to a register if they have been exposed to the suspected causative agent10. ‘Response bias’ is another type of selection bias that occurs if differences in characteristics between those who respond and those who decline participation in a study affect estimates of prevalence, incidence and, in some circumstances, associations. In general, selection bias affects the internal validity of a study. This is different from problems that may arise with the selection of participants for a study in general, which affects the external rather than the internal validity of a study (also see 21. Generalisability).",

We also recalculated the relative risk for POAG with additional control for covariates associated with more careful ocular surveillance (a self-report of cataract, macular degeneration, number of eye examinations, and number of physical examinations)”2.",

    "text": "Explanation\nReaders need descriptions of study participants and their exposures to judge the generalisability of the findings. Information about potential confounders, including whether and how they were measured, influences judgments about study validity. We advise authors to summarize continuous variables for each study group by giving the mean and standard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetrical distribution, as is often the case, the median and percentile range (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make up a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be presented as continuous variables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions for each category (see also 6b. Matching criteria ). In studies that compare groups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should be given by group, as in the example above.\nInferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important1,2.\nIn cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential confounders. Authors could present this information in a table with columns for participants in two or more exposure categories, which permits to judge the differences in confounders between these categories.\nIn case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control persons represent the source population and will usually be different from the cases in many respects. For example, in a study of oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample of young women with infarction more often had risk factors for that disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and a positive family history, than the control group3. This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guided by the presence of these risk factors—e.g., because the risk factors were only established after the event (see also 12a. Statistical methods). In case-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed and non-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as is done in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the source population of the cases: if the control group is large enough and represents the source population, exposed and unexposed controls can be compared for potential confounders4,5.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe heart of the discussion section is the interpretation of a study’s results. Over-interpretation is common and human: even when we try hard to give an objective assessment, reviewers often rightly point out that we went too far in some respects. When interpreting results, authors should consider the nature of the study on the discovery to verification continuum and potential sources of bias, including loss to follow-up and non-participation (see also items 9. Bias, 12di. Statistical methods – loss to follow-up and 19. Limitations). Due consideration should be given to confounding (see 16a. Main results), the results of relevant sensitivity analyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroup analyses (17. Other analyses). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise measurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with many health outcomes and often differs between groups being compared. Variables used to measure SES (income, education, or occupation) are surrogates for other undefined and unmeasured exposures, and the true confounder will by definition be measured with error1. Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statistical uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals. The latter do not take into account other uncertainties that arise from a study’s design, implementation, and methods of measurement2.\nTo guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may find criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965 helpful3. How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association consistently observed in different studies and settings? Is there supporting evidence from experimental studies, including laboratory and animal studies? How specific is the exposure’s putative effect, and is there a dose-response relationship? Is the association biologically plausible? These criteria should not, however, be applied mechanically. For example, some have argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should be ignored4,5. This is a reversal of the point by Cornfield et al. about the strength of large relative risks (see 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions)6. Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious. For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhood leukaemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because it concerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for which no alternative explanations are obvious7. Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating 2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, since dietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestyle factors as well as SES8. In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic findings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives was greatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in a randomised cross-over trial9. A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important for studies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authors should put their results in context with similar studies and explain how the new study affects the existing body of evidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review.",

It is important not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the relative importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias (see also 9. Bias and 9. Bias).\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (see 10. Study size) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (see 8. Data sources / measurement). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as ‘attenuation’1,2, or more recently as ‘regression dilution bias’3. However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with them can be biased towards or away from unity6.\nWhen discussing limitations, authors may compare the study being presented with other studies in the literature in terms of validity, generalisability and precision. In this approach, each study can be viewed as contribution to the literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and action7. Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A survey of authors who had published original research articles in The Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study were reported by the investigators in the survey questionnaires, but not in the published article8.",

    "text": "Explanation\nThe results from studies examining the association between an exposure and a disease are commonly reported in relative terms, as ratios of risks, rates or odds (see 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions ). Relative measures capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confounding1,2. Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially between these countries3,4. In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio5.\nWidely used statistical models, including logistic6 and proportional hazards (Cox) regression7 are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI, see 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions and 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions#interaction), can be estimated in models based on ratio measures.\nIn many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years8. Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship between a risk factor and disease (also see below)9. Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used10.\nA recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohort studies11. A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 3112.\n\nMeasures of association, effect and impact\nObservational studies may be solely done to describe the magnitude and distribution of a health problem in the population. They may examine the number of people who have a disease at a particular time (prevalence), or that develop a disease over a defined period (incidence). The incidence may be expressed as the proportion of people developing the disease (cumulative incidence) or as a rate per person-time of follow-up (incidence rate). Specific terms are used to describe different incidences; amongst others, mortality rate, birth rate, attack rate, or case fatality rate. Similarly, terms like point prevalence and period, annual or lifetime prevalence are used to describe different types of prevalence13.\nOther observational studies address cause-effect relationships. Their focus is the comparison of the risk, rate or prevalence of the event of interest between those exposed and those not exposed to the risk factor under investigation. These studies often estimate a ‘relative risk’, which may stand for risk ratios (ratios of cumulative incidences) as well as rate ratios (ratios of incidence rates). In case-control studies only a fraction of the source population (the controls) are included. Results are expressed as the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases and controls. This odds ratio provides an estimate of the risk or rate ratio depending on the sampling of cases and controls14,15. The prevalence ratio or prevalence odds ratio from cross-sectional studies may be useful in some situations16.\nExpressing results both in relative and absolute terms may often be helpful. For example, in a study of male British doctors the incidence rate of death from lung cancer over 50 years of follow-up was 249 per 100,000 per year among smokers, compared to 17 per 100,000 per year among non-smokers: a rate ratio of 14.6 (249/17)17. For coronary heart disease (CHD), the corresponding rates were 1001 and 619 per 100,000 per year, for a rate ratio of 1.61 (1001/619). The effect of smoking on death appears much stronger for lung cancer than for CHD. The picture changes when we consider the absolute effects of smoking. The difference in incidence rates was 232 per 100,000 per year (249 − 17) for lung cancer and 382 for CHD (1001 − 619). Therefore, among doctors who smoked, smoking was more likely to cause death from CHD than from lung cancer.\nHow much of the disease burden in a population could be prevented by eliminating an exposure? Global estimates have been published for smoking: according to one study 91% of all lung cancers, 40% of CHD and 33% of all deaths among men in 2000 were attributed to smoking18. The population attributable fraction is generally defined as the proportion of cases caused by a particular exposure, but several concepts (and no unified terminology) exist, and incorrect approaches to adjust for other factors are sometimes used10,19. What are the implications for reporting? The relative measures emphasise the strength of an association, and are most useful in etiologic research. If a causal relationship with an exposure is documented and associations are interpreted as effects, estimates of relative risk may be translated into suitable measures of absolute risk in order to gauge the possible impact of public health policies20. However, authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context9. Care is needed in deciding which concept and method is appropriate for a particular situation.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nMatching is much more common in case-control studies, but occasionally, investigators use matching in cohort studies to make groups comparable at the start of follow-up. Matching in cohort studies makes groups directly comparable for potential confounders and presents fewer intricacies than with case-control studies. For example, it is not necessary to take the matching into account for the estimation of the relative risk1. Because matching in cohort studies may increase statistical precision investigators might allow for the matching in their analyses and thus obtain narrower confidence intervals.\nIn case-control studies matching is done to increase a study’s efficiency by ensuring similarity in the distribution of variables between cases and controls, in particular the distribution of potential confounding variables1,2. Because matching can be done in various ways, with one or more controls per case, the rationale for the choice of matching variables and the details of the method used should be described. Commonly used forms of matching are frequency matching (also called group matching) and individual matching. In frequency matching, investigators choose controls so that the distribution of matching variables becomes identical or similar to that of cases. Individual matching involves matching one or several controls to each case. Although intuitively appealing and sometimes useful, matching in case-control studies has a number of disadvantages, is not always appropriate, and needs to be taken into account in the analysis (see below).\nEven apparently simple matching procedures may be poorly reported. For example, authors may state that controls were matched to cases ‘within five years’, or using ‘five year age bands’. Does this mean that, if a case was 54 years old, the respective control needed to be in the five-year age band 50 to 54, or aged 49 to 59, which is within five years of age 54? If a wide (e.g., 10-year) age band is chosen, there is a danger of residual confounding by age (see below), for example because controls may then be younger than cases on average.\n\nMatching in case-control studies\nIn any case-control study, sensible choices need to be made on whether to use matching of controls to cases, and if so, what variables to match on, the precise method of matching to use, and the appropriate method of statistical analysis. Not to match at all may mean that the distribution of some key potential confounders (e.g., age, sex) is radically different between cases and controls. Although this could be adjusted for in the analysis there could be a major loss in statistical efficiency.\nThe use of matching in case-control studies and its interpretation are fraught with difficulties, especially if matching is attempted on several risk factors, some of which may be linked to the exposure of prime interest3,4. For example, in a case-control study of myocardial infarction and oral contraceptives nested in a large pharmaco-epidemiologic data base, with information about thousands of women who are available as potential controls, investigators may be tempted to choose matched controls who had similar levels of risk factors to each case of myocardial infarction. One objective is to adjust for factors that might influence the prescription of oral contraceptives and thus to control for confounding by indication. However, the result will be a control group that is no longer representative of the oral contraceptive use in the source population: controls will be older than the source population because patients with myocardial infarction tend to be older. This has several implications. A crude analysis of the data will produce odds ratios that are usually biased towards unity if the matching factor is associated with the exposure. The solution is to perform a matched or stratified analysis (see 12dii. Statistical methods – matching cases and controls). In addition, because the matched control group ceases to be representative for the population at large, the exposure distribution among the controls can no longer be used to estimate the population attributable fraction (see 16c. Main results – risk#measures-of-association)5. Also, the effect of the matching factor can no longer be studied, and the search for well-matched controls can be cumbersome – making a design with a non-matched control group preferable because the non-matched controls will be easier to obtain and the control group can be larger. Overmatching is another problem, which may reduce the efficiency of matched case-control studies, and, in some situations, introduce bias. Information is lost and the power of the study is reduced if the matching variable is closely associated with the exposure. Then many individuals in the same matched sets will tend to have identical or similar levels of exposures and therefore not contribute relevant information. Matching will introduce irremediable bias if the matching variable is not a confounder but in the causal pathway between exposure and disease. For example, in vitro fertilization is associated with an increased risk of perinatal death, due to an increase in multiple births and low birth weight infants6. Matching on plurality or birth weight will bias results towards the null, and this cannot be remedied in the analysis.\nMatching is intuitively appealing, but the complexities involved have led methodologists to advise against routine matching in case-control studies. They recommend instead a careful and judicious consideration of each potential matching factor, recognizing that it could instead be measured and used as an adjustment variable without matching on it. In response, there has been a reduction in the number of matching factors employed, an increasing use of frequency matching, which avoids some of the problems discussed above, and more case-control studies with no matching at all7. Matching remains most desirable, or even necessary, when the distributions of the confounder (e.g., age) might differ radically between the unmatched comparison groups1,2.\n\n\nGrouping\nThere are several reasons why continuous data may be grouped8. When collecting data it may be better to use an ordinal variable than to seek an artificially precise continuous measure for an exposure based on recall over several years. Categories may also be helpful for presentation, for example to present all variables in a similar style, or to show a dose-response relationship.\nGrouping may also be done to simplify the analysis, for example to avoid an assumption of linearity. However, grouping loses information and may reduce statistical power9 especially when dichotomization is used10–12. If a continuous confounder is grouped, residual confounding may occur, whereby some of the variable’s confounding effect remains unadjusted for (see 12a. Statistical methods)13,14. Increasing the number of categories can diminish power loss and residual confounding, and is especially appropriate in large studies. Small studies may use few groups because of limited numbers.\nInvestigators may choose cut-points for groupings based on commonly used values that are relevant for diagnosis or prognosis, for practicality, or on statistical grounds. They may choose equal numbers of individuals in each group using quantiles15. On the other hand, one may gain more insight into the association with the outcome by choosing more extreme outer groups and having the middle group(s) larger than the outer groups16. In case-control studies, deriving a distribution from the control group is preferred since it is intended to reflect the source population. Readers should be informed if cut-points are selected post hoc from several alternatives. In particular, if the cut-points were chosen to minimise a P value the true strength of an association will be exaggerated17.\nWhen analysing grouped variables, it is important to recognise their underlying continuous nature. For instance, a possible trend in risk across ordered groups can be investigated. A common approach is to model the rank of the groups as a continuous variable. Such linearity across group scores will approximate an actual linear relation if groups are equally spaced (e.g., 10 year age groups) but not otherwise. Il’yasova et al18. recommend publication of both the categorical and the continuous estimates of effect, with their standard errors, in order to facilitate meta-analysis, as well as providing intrinsically valuable information on dose-response. One analysis may inform the other and neither is assumption-free. Authors often ignore the ordering and consider the estimates (and P values) separately for each category compared to the reference category. This may be useful for description, but may fail to detect a real trend in risk across groups. If a trend is observed, a confidence interval for a slope might indicate the strength of the observation.",

Second, each statin user was matched to a smaller pool of non-statin-users by sex, age (plus or minus 1 year), and index date (plus or minus 3 months).

    "text": "Explanation\nIn addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specific subgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, the calculation of attributable risks, or use alternative definitions of study variables in sensitivity analyses.\nThere is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in general1,2. In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specific associations, or effect-measure modification, when overall results appear to suggest little or no effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploring whether an overall association appears consistent across several, preferably pre-specified subgroups especially when a study is large enough to have sufficient data in each subgroup. A second area of debate is about interesting subgroups that arose during the data analysis. They might be important findings, but might also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possible nor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analyses done as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent the early exciting findings stand the test of time3. We advise authors to report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4. Study design, 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions and 20. Interpretation). This will allow readers to judge the implications of multiplicity, taking into account the study’s position on the continuum from discovery to verification or refutation.\nA third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions and 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions )? A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect—if possible in a table, as in the first example above4, or in the study by Martinelli et al.5. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions ). Confidence intervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an association differs across subgroups.\nSensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate the robustness of the findings to missing data or possible biases (see also 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions). Judgement is needed regarding the level of reporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses were performed, it may be impractical to present detailed findings for them all. It may sometimes be sufficient to report that sensitivity analyses were carried out and that they were consistent with the main results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriate if the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimates vary considerably6,7.\nPocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. The majority claimed differences across groups but only eight articles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see 12b. Statistical methods – subgroups and interactions)1.",

    "text": "Explanation\nDetailed information on the process of recruiting study participants is important for several reasons. Those included in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied. This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused1. These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such response bias (see 9. Bias) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies2,3, was explained by differential participation of young women in case and control groups. Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than those with unhealthy children4. Although low participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study, transparent information on participation and reasons for non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated such proportions5.\nIdeally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants, from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of participants’ data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study, this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and control groups6. Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods7.\nA recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies (59%)8. Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and non-participation in epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the literature9,10. Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades8,11, which underscores the need for transparent reporting12.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIn general, there is no one correct statistical analysis but, rather, several possibilities that may address the same question, but make different assumptions. Regardless, investigators should pre-determine analyses at least for the primary study objectives in a study protocol. Often additional analyses are needed, either instead of, or as well as, those originally envisaged, and these may sometimes be motivated by the data. When a study is reported, authors should tell readers whether particular analyses were suggested by data inspection. Even though the distinction between pre-specified and exploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authors should clarify reasons for particular analyses.\nIf groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possible confounding variables by stratification or by multivariable regression (see 12a. Statistical methods)1. Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohort studies2. whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies3,4. Analysts should fully describe specific procedures for variable selection and not only present results from the final model5,6. If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a final model, this process should be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or two covariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparent confounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses such as imputation procedures, data transformation, and calculations of attributable risks should also be described. Non-standard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statistical software used reported. As a guiding principle, we advise statistical methods be described “with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results”7.\nIn an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated how continuous and multi-category variables were entered into the statistical model8. Another study found that among 67 articles in which statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders, it was mostly unclear how confounders were chosen9.\n\nConfounding\nConfounding literally means confusion of effects. A study might seem to show either an association or no association between an exposure and the risk of a disease. In reality, the seeming association or lack of association is due to another factor that determines the occurrence of the disease but that is also associated with the exposure. The other factor is called the confounding factor or confounder. Confounding thus gives a wrong assessment of the potential ‘causal’ association of an exposure. For example, if women who approach middle age and develop elevated blood pressure are less often prescribed oral contraceptives, a simple comparison of the frequency of cardiovascular disease between those who use contraceptives and those who do not, might give the wrong impression that contraceptives protect against heart disease.\nInvestigators should think beforehand about potential confounding factors. This will inform the study design and allow proper data collection by identifying the confounders for which detailed information should be sought. Restriction or matching may be used. In the example above, the study might be restricted to women who do not have the confounder, elevated blood pressure. Matching on blood pressure might also be possible, though not necessarily desirable (see 6b. Matching criteria). In the analysis phase, investigators may use stratification or multivariable analysis to reduce the effect of confounders. Stratification consists of dividing the data in strata for the confounder (e.g., strata of blood pressure), assessing estimates of association within each stratum, and calculating the combined estimate of association as a weighted average over all strata. Multivariable analysis achieves the same result but permits one to take more variables into account simultaneously. It is more flexible but may involve additional assumptions about the mathematical form of the relationship between exposure and disease.\nTaking confounders into account is crucial in observational studies, but readers should not assume that analyses adjusted for confounders establish the ‘causal part’ of an association.

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nIn individually matched case-control studies a crude analysis of the odds ratio, ignoring the matching, usually leads to an estimation that is biased towards unity (see 6b. Matching criteria ). A matched analysis is therefore often necessary. This can intuitively be understood as a stratified analysis: each case is seen as one stratum with his or her set of matched controls. The analysis rests on considering whether the case is more often exposed than the controls, despite having made them alike regarding the matching variables. Investigators can do such a stratified analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method on a ‘matched’ 2 by 2 table. In its simplest form the odds ratio becomes the ratio of pairs that are discordant for the exposure variable. If matching was done for variables like age and sex that are universal attributes, the analysis needs not retain the individual, person-to-person matching: a simple analysis in categories of age and sex is sufficient1. For other matching variables, such as neighbourhood, sibship, or friendship, however, each matched set should be considered its own stratum.\nIn individually matched studies, the most widely used method of analysis is conditional logistic regression, in which each case and their controls are considered together. The conditional method is necessary when the number of controls varies among cases, and when, in addition to the matching variables, other variables need to be adjusted for. To allow readers to judge whether the matched design was appropriately taken into account in the analysis, we recommend that authors describe in detail what statistical methods were used to analyse the data. If taking the matching into account does have little effect on the estimates, authors may choose to present an unmatched analysis.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nSensitivity analyses are useful to investigate whether or not the main results are consistent with those obtained with alternative analysis strategies or assumptions1. Issues that may be examined include the criteria for inclusion in analyses, the definitions of exposures or outcomes2, which confounding variables merit adjustment, the handling of missing data3,4, possible selection bias or bias from inaccurate or inconsistent measurement of exposure, disease and other variables, and specific analysis choices, such as the treatment of quantitative variables (see 11. Quantitative variables). Sophisticated methods are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several biases or assumptions5–7.\nIn 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers8. This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power lines9. More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or information bias required to distort an association. One important, perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are present.",

We have, therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We have assumed that the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in the study group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4% for live patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios: either all the exposed missing patients used second generation pills or they all used third-generation pills”3.",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nWe advise presenting key elements of study design early in the methods section (or at the end of the introduction) so that readers can understand the basics of the study. For example, authors should indicate that the study was a cohort study, which followed people over a particular time period, and describe the group of persons that comprised the cohort and their exposure status. Similarly, if the investigation used a case-control design, the cases and controls and their source population should be described. If the study was a cross-sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned. When a study is a variant of the three main study types, there is an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the example above1.\nWe recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study ‘prospective’ or ‘retrospective’ because these terms are ill defined2. One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case-control studies3. A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study was developed4. A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases were selected5. Some advise against using these terms6, or adopting the alternatives ‘concurrent’ and ‘historical’ for describing cohort studies7. In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and historical. We recommend that, whenever authors use these words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how and when data collection took place.\nThe first part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from a study. If a new report is in line with the original aims of the study, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlier publication and by briefly restating the salient features of the study. However, the aims of a study may also evolve over time. Researchers often use data for purposes for which they were not originally intended, including, for example, official vital statistics that were collected primarily for administrative purposes, items in questionnaires that originally were only included for completeness, or blood samples that were collected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians’ Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and carotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutation in the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not of myocardial infarction or stroke8. The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important. However, briefly restating the original aims might help readers understand the context of the research and possible limitations in the data.",

We compared a driver's use of a mobile phone at the estimated time of a crash with the same driver's use during another suitable time period. Because drivers are their own controls, the design controls for characteristics of the driver that may affect the risk of a crash but do not change over a short period of time. As it is important that risks during control periods and crash trips are similar, we compared phone activity during the hazard interval (time immediately before the crash) with phone activity during control intervals (equivalent times during which participants were driving but did not crash) in the previous week”1.",
