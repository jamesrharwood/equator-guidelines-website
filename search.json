They obtain information about people and their exposures at baseline, let time pass, and then assess the occurrence of outcomes. Investigators commonly make contrasts between individuals who are exposed and not exposed or among groups of individuals with different categories of exposure. Investigators may assess several different outcomes, and examine exposure and outcome variables at multiple points during follow-up. Closed cohorts (for example birth cohorts) enrol a defined number of participants at study onset and follow them from that time forward, often at set intervals up to a fixed end date. In open cohorts the study population is dynamic - people enter and leave the population at different points in time (for example inhabitants of a town). Open cohorts change due to deaths, births, and migration, but the composition of the population with regard to variables such as age and gender may remain approximately constant, especially over a short period of time. In a closed cohort cumulative incidences (risks) and incidence rates can be estimated; when exposed and unexposed groups are compared, this leads to risk ratio or rate ratio estimates. Open cohorts estimate incidence rates and rate ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase_control_studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case-control studies, investigators compare exposures between people with a particular disease outcome (cases) and people without that outcome (controls). Investigators aim to collect cases and controls that are representative of an underlying cohort or a cross-section of a population. That population can be defined geographically, but also more loosely as the catchment area of health care facilities. The case sample may be 100% or a large fraction of available cases, while the control sample usually is only a small fraction of the people who do not have the pertinent outcome. Controls represent the cohort or population of people from which the cases arose. Investigators calculate the ratio of the odds of exposures to putative causes of the disease among cases and controls (see Item 16c). Depending on the sampling strategy for cases and controls and the nature of the population studied, the odds ratio obtained in a case-control study is interpreted as the risk ratio, rate ratio or (prevalence) odds ratio1,2. The majority of published case-control studies sample open cohorts and so allow direct estimations of rate ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-sectional_studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn cross-sectional studies, investigators assess all individuals in a sample at the same point in time, often to examine the prevalence of exposures, risk factors or disease. Some cross-sectional studies are analytical and aim to quantify potential causal associations between exposures and disease. Such studies may be analysed like a cohort study by comparing disease prevalence between exposure groups. They may also be analysed like a case-control study by comparing the odds of exposure between groups with and without disease. A difficulty that can occur in any design but is particularly clear in cross-sectional studies is to establish that an exposure preceded the disease, although the time order of exposure and outcome may sometimes be clear. In a study in which the exposure variable is congenital or genetic, for example, we can be confident that the exposure preceded the disease, even if we are measuring both at the same time.",

Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical aspects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of system-level initiatives relative to their potential for harm, burden, and cost to the stakeholders. Potential harms particularly associated with efforts to improve the quality, safety, and value of healthcare services include opportunity costs, invasion of privacy, and staff distress resulting from disclosure of poor performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralizability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likelihood that the intervention(s) in a particular report would produce similar results in other settings, situations, or environments (also referred to as external validity). Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare improvement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny systematic effort intended to raise the quality, safety, and value of healthcare services, usually done at the system level. We encourage the use of this phrase rather than “quality improvement,” which often refers to more narrowly defined approaches. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of findings or data, as interpreted by the stakeholders in healthcare services - improvers, healthcare delivery professionals, and/or patients and families.

Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal validity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrable, credible evidence for efficacy (meaningful impact or change) resulting from introduction of a specific intervention into a particular healthcare system. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterventions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe specific activities and tools introduced into a healthcare system with the aim of changing its performance for the better. Complete description of an intervention includes its inputs, internal activities, and outputs (in the form of a logic model, for example), and the mechanism(s) by which these components are expected to produce changes in a system’s performance. Source #TODO check matches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of the ability to perform other tasks or meet other responsibilities resulting from the diversion of resources needed to introduce, test, or sustain a particular improvement initiative. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeaningful disruption, failure, inadequacy, distress, confusion or other dysfunction in a healthcare service delivery system that adversely affects patients, staff, or the system as a whole, or that prevents care from reaching its full potential. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe routines and other activities through which healthcare services are delivered. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRationale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of why particular intervention(s) were chosen and why it was expected to work, be sustainable, and be replicable elsewhere. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interrelated structures, people, processes, and activities that together create healthcare services for and with individual patients and populations. For example, systems exist from the personal self-care system of a patient, to the individual provider-patient dyad system, to the microsystem, to the macrosystem, and all the way to the market/social/insurance system. These levels are nested within each other. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny “reason-giving” account that asserts causal relationships between variables (causal theory) or that makes sense of an otherwise obscure process or situation (explanatory theory). Theories come in many forms, and serve different purposes in the phases of improvement work. It is important to be explicit and well-founded about any informal and formal theory (or theories) that are used. Source",

Records that refer to the same report (such as the same journal article) are “duplicates”; however, records that refer to reports that are merely similar (such as a similar abstract submitted to two different conferences) should be considered unique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn investigation, such as a clinical trial, that includes a defined group of participants and one or more interventions and outcomes. A “study” might have multiple reports. For example, reports could include the protocol, statistical analysis plan, baseline characteristics, results for the primary outcome, results for harms, results for secondary outcomes, and results for additional mediator and moderator analyses.",

    "text": "Ready to get started?\nDownload resources\n\n\n\nAnimal research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen ARRIVE refers to animal research it is referring to in vivo animal research. This is the use of non-human animals, sometimes known as model organisms, in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Animal research varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Source” The ARRIVE guidelines apply to all areas of bioscience research involving living animals. That includes mammalian species as well as model organisms such as Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans. Each item is equally relevant to manuscripts centred around a single animal study and broader-scope manuscripts describing in vivo observations along with other types of experiments. The exact type of detail to report, however, might vary between species and experimental setup; this is acknowledged in the guidance provided for each item. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe over- or underestimation of the true effect of an intervention. Bias is caused by inadequacies in the design, conduct, or analysis of an experiment, resulting in the introduction of error.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive and inferential statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are used to summarise the data. They generally include a measure of central tendency (e.g., mean or median) and a measure of spread (e.g., standard deviation or range). Inferential statistics are used to make generalisations about the population from which the samples are drawn. Hypothesis tests such as ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, or t tests are examples of inferential statistics.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative measure of differences between groups, or strength of relationships between variables.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological entity subjected to an intervention independently of all other units, such that it is possible to assign any two experimental units to different treatment groups. Sometimes known as unit of randomisation.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal validity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtent to which the results of a given study enable application or generalisation to other studies, study conditions, animal strains/species, or humans.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse negative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistically nonsignificant result obtained when the alternative hypothesis (H1) is true. In statistics, it is known as the type II error.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse positive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistically significant result obtained when the null hypothesis (H0) is true. In statistics, it is known as the type I error.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable that either the researcher manipulates (treatment, condition, time) or is a property of the sample (sex) or a technical feature (batch, cage, sample collection) that can potentially affect the outcome measure. Independent variables can be scientifically interesting, or nuisance variables. Also known as predictor variable.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal validity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtent to which the results of a given study can be attributed to the effects of the experimental intervention, rather than some other, unknown factor(s) (e.g., inadequacies in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study introducing bias).Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuisance variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables that are not of primary interest but should be considered in the experimental design or the analysis because they may affect the outcome measure and add variability. They become confounders if, in addition, they are correlated with an independent variable of interest, as this introduces bias. Nuisance variables should be considered in the design of the experiment (to prevent them from becoming confounders) and in the analysis (to account for the variability and sometimes to reduce bias). For example, nuisance variables can be used as blocking factors or covariates.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull and alternative hypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no effect, such as a difference between groups or an association between variables. The alternative hypothesis (H1) postulates that an effect exists.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome measure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny variable recorded during a study to assess the effects of a treatment or experimental intervention. Also known as dependent variable, response variable.Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a predefined, biologically meaningful effect size, the probability that the statistical test will detect the effect if it exists (i.e., the null hypothesis is rejected correctly).Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of experimental units per group, also referred to as n.Source",

    "title": "Using Reporting Guidelines to Draft Research Articles: A Step-by-Step Guide",
    "section": "The writing process",
    "text": "The writing process\nIf you have ever taken a holiday, you will know there is a good way and a bad way to pack a suitcase.\nThe bad way is to fling things in, as and when you think of them. Rushed and stressed, the disorganised packer struggles to close their bloated bag and upon unpacking, their clothes are creased, possessions jumbled, and their toothbrush is forgotten at home.\nAn organised packer has a process. Often this begins with a list, laying everything out in front of you, then carefully deciding which items belong in the suitcase, which will go in carry-on, and how clothes can be folded to minimise space and creasing. The organised packer feels relaxed and enjoys their journey in the confidence that they’ve forgotten nothing.\nWriting academic articles is a lot like packing a suitcase. The author has to cram a lot of information into a small space, without crumpling the message they are trying to convey. Reporting guidelines act as the packing list, and the process we describe below covers the act of collating your stuff (information), laying it out (on the page), deciding what goes where (reorganising), and then finally, packing (writing a first draft).\n\nStep 1: Get the appropriate writing guide\nDownload the writing guide for the reporting guideline that matches your study design. For reporting guidelines not featured on this website, you can find their available resources by searching our database.\n\n\nStep 2: Collate information\nGather your research materials (e.g., your notes, data, analyses, protocol)\nFor each section in the writing guide:\n\nAnswers the prompting questions\nDocument any information that cannot be included and why\nIdentify information that would benefit from visual presentation.\n\nDraft tables.\nCollate figures that already exist. If custom figures need to be made, note down what information they should convey.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Content Organization and Prioritization\nBy now you may already have a target journal in mind. Review their author instructions for word limits, figure/table allowances, and supplementary material policies.\nBegin reorganising your notes into a structure that fits your narrative and priorities. You might prefer to do this in a new document, or to delete the provided writing guide section titles and prompts. Group your notes into paragraphs. Some authors like to assign word limits to paragraphs or sections at this stage. Consider adding topic and linking sentences to the start and end of each paragraph. This helps creates flow.\nWhen organising content, consider how important the information will be to most of your readers. Prioritise information you expect most readers will find important. Content you expect only a small section of your audience will seek out can be placed later in your writing, allocated less space or, if necessary, be placed in supplementary material. Do not delete any information – although you may consider it unimportant, every item in a reporting guideline is important to somebody.\nBy now, your notes should be grouped into paragraphs, separated into main text and supplementary materials, and be filled with all of the information, data, and sources you’ll need to write. You should have drafted your tables and planned your figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNow is a good moment to talk a colleague through your outline. Your notes will be brief and rough, but someone familiar with the work will be able to give feedback on your proposed structure and content.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Writing the First Draft\nOnce you are ready to start drafting, open a new document. Your writing guide is probably very long by now, so writing in a new document means you can maintain focus without deleting notes.\nWe suggest you begin by drafting the Methods section as this is generally the easiest to get started with, then the Results before the Introduction, Discussion and, finally, the Abstract and Title. When drafting, try not to use your delete key. The aim is get words on the page, no matter how messy they are. If you get stuck on something, consider using a placeholder (like #TODO) and come back to it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is another good moment to get feedback from colleagues. Give them your manuscript and ask whether the structure and flow make sense. Because it’s only a first draft, you may want to ask them to not worry about spelling, grammar, or conciseness.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Revision and editing\nReview the draft for logical flow between sections.\nEdit your text to make it clear, concise and engaging.\nOnce the text is ready to submit, complete the reporting checklist for the reporting guideline you used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is an opportunity for a final round of feedback from a colleague. You may want to ask them to do a more through edit of your writing, fixing any errors and reworking sentences for clarity and conciseness. Consider asking a colleague to complete the reporting checklist on their own as part of this review, or to look through the checklist you already completed. This will allow you to check whether your interpretation of the guidance requirements matches theirs, and whether you have presented information clearly.\n\n\nAdd the completed reporting checklist as a supplement, and ensure you have credited the reporting guideline, checklist, and writing guide.\n\n\nSubmission\nInclude your completed reporting checklist as a supplement when you submit to your chosen journal. If your target journal/funder do not accept supplementary material, you can upload your checklist to a repository like the OSF and cite it."

    "text": "What are reporting guidelines?\nReporting guidelines are recommendations of information to include when writing up research. They ensure research can be understood and used by a wide audience including other researchers, editors, reviewers, clinicians, evidence synthesisers, and readers from different fields, countries, or background, even decades in the future.\nReporting guidelines help researchers write academic articles, protocols, and funding applications. They make writing less daunting by breaking the process up into bite-size chunks, without dictating the final structure. They help authors lay out the key information – the building blocks – of their work. Authors then decide how best to arrange this information to build a compelling and clear account.\nHowever, reporting guidelines are not design standards or tools for quality appraisal. They do not dictate how research must be conducted, but they do ensure research is described clearly enough for readers to understand its strengths and limitations.\nWhy do we need them? Because for decades, researchers have missed out important details because of oversight, or because they have not considered their audience’s needs. These gaps make it harder for others to replicate, understand, or apply the findings — and may exclude research from reviews or clinical use. This is a massive source of waste that pervades all research areas. Well-reported research has greater impact.\n\nReporting guidelines are made by expert groups. Most groups follow a systematic, consensus development method to create and publish a checklist, sometimes accompanied by a longer explanation paper that provides context and examples for each checklist item.\nTo make these resources easier to use, we at the EQUATOR Network built this website in collaboration with authors, editors, and the developers of the most-used open access reporting guidelines."

Whether you write from introduction to discussion, or prefer to start by writing your methods or results.\nThey are especially useful to researchers with less writing experience, who haven’t found an approach to writing that works for them.\nThey break the writing process into manageable pieces. Read the guidance before you begin writing. If you like to plan your writing, consider working though items and collating notes into a document, then organise your notes into coherent structure with logical narrative structure.\nYou decide how best to arrange information, and whether to present it in the article body, in a figure or table, or in a supplement.\nTo learn more about writing skills, develop good writing habits, and how to use reporting guidelines, see our training."

    "text": "Reporting checklists\nReporting guideline checklists allow authors to demonstrate how their work complies with a reporting guideline. By including a completed checklist as supplementary material, authors can reassure editors and peer reviewers their article is complete. Publishing checklists as supplements also helps readers and evidence synthesisers to find and extract information.\nReporting checklists are best used at the end of writing, before journal submission. Specify where readers can find each reporting item by directing them to parts of the manuscript e.g.,\n\nMethods, para. 2\nTable 2\nSupplement A, para. 4 and Figure S1.\n\nSome older reporting checklists asked authors to state page numbers for each item. We recommend against this because:\n\nPage numbers easily change when editing a document.\nWhen you submit, most journals generate a PDF of your manuscript combined with other submission data. The page numbers in your checklist will not correspond to this PDF, and so won’t be useful to editors nor reviewers.\nWhen published, online articles don’t have pages and PDF pages won’t correspond to your original file, so page numbers won’t help readers.\n\nConversely, if you specify which section, paragraph, table, figure, or supplement contains a reporting guideline item, editors, peer reviewers, and future readers will easily be able to find it.\nIf you have chosen not to report an item, explain why. You can do this in the checklist, or as a note below it. Otherwise editors or peer reviewers may chase you for this information, thereby delaying publication. These explanations will also help future evidence reviewers – who commonly use reporting guidelines when assessing the the quality of reporting and risk of bias – meaning your article may be more likely to be included in their reviews.\nAs with reporting guidelines, checklists do not dictate how research should be conducted nor how manuscripts should be structured."

Its design and architecture were informed by a programme of research exploring why researchers often fail to adhere to reporting guidelines. This programme included a qualitative evidence synthesis, review of surveys, workshops and focus groups with experts, and interviews with researchers. It can be read here\n\nAs a reporting guideline developer, you have control over your own guideline content. To get you started, we set up a blank repository for you in GitHub.\n\nYou add (or edit) your guideline content. Reporting guidelines are stored as simple text files and metadata. There is one text file per reporting item. You can add images, embed videos, pop-up definitions, links to training or other help, and you can annotate examples of good and bad reporting. In the future we hope to offer a simple interface for editing content, but for now you can edit files directly within GitHub from your browser or from your computer if you are comfortable using git.\nYou notify us that your guideline is ready for publication using GitHub’s Release button. Tests run automatically to make sure your files are in the right structure and have the necessary metadata. If these tests pass, we create a version of your guideline using Zenodo. This means researchers can cite the exact version of your guideline that they followed.\nResources are generated from your files. These resources currently include:\n\nWeb pages: Your reporting guideline will have an overview page that tells users how to use your guideline, what research it applies to, links to other guidelines (that you specify), and a summary of the guidance items. Each reporting item has its own page. All pages have metadata that optimizes them for search engines, large language models, and chat bots.\n\nChecklists: Downloadable Word files, where each item links back to the item’s web page.\nDiscussion Boards: Each item links to a discussion board where researchers can ask questions and give feedback.\nFuture resources: In the future, you will be able to generate other resources including AI agents and writing templates.\n\nThe website is updated with your new resources.\nWe run some more automated tests before the updated website is published.\nWhen researchers leave comments on your reporting items’ discussion boards, these comment threads are saved to your GitHub repository so you will be notified of feedback. You can then update your reporting guideline in response to this feedback."

These tests must pass for commits to the master branch and releases to be accepted.\nIf tests pass, GitHub actions notifies Zenodo to update DOI so that the version becomes citable and notifies the main platform repository to pull the updated guideline. The main platform pulls the updated DOI from Zenodo, runs some Python scripts to regenerate reporting guideline resources. By default these include a checklist file, a summary webpage, webpages for each reporting item, and discussion board pages for each item. Python generates these resources as Markdown files.\nQuarto converts these Markdown files into other formats (HTML for web pages, Microsoft Word for documents etc).\nA second set of automated tests validate the generated resources and website.\nOnce built, the website is served using GitHub Pages. Each reporting guideline item has its own Giscus discussion board, where comments are stored as GitHub Discussions linked to the relevant file stored in the reporting guideline repository."

    "text": "Professor Hywel Williams, Clinical Trials Editor of the Journal of Investigative Dermatology\nThe Journal of Investigative Dermatology (JID) is the leading scientific dermatology journal with an impact factor of 5.25 in 2008. The JID publishes original research on all aspects of cutaneous biology and skin disease. Although the majority of the journal content deals with basic science, its scope includes clinical research, clinical trials and epidemiology. I have been fortunate in working for the JID for the last 6 years as section editor, with particular responsibilities for clinical trials. In 2006, the JID made a clear announcement that it would welcome high quality clinical trial submissions, providing they were registered prospectively and that they adhered to the CONSORT checklist.\nStating such intent is all very well, but how does a journal like the JID go about implementing CONSORT and compulsory trial registration and how does it check on compliance to CONSORT?\nThis is how we did it. I first met with the Managing Editor, Elizabeth Blalock. We devised a system whereby submissions referring to clinical trials are reviewed by the JID office for trial registration details and adherence to CONSORT (i.e., submission of CONSORT checklist, flowchart, and appropriate manuscript headings). When the editorial office is in doubt whether the submission is a therapeutic trial (which is not always easy with studies that mainly look at disease mechanisms), the staff sends me the article to check. If it is deemed to be a therapeutic trial, then the editorial office contacts the authors for proof of trial registration and adherence to CONSORT prior to admitting the manuscript for peer review. Only those submissions in compliance with the full CONSORT (and journal) requirements are sent for content and methodological peer review. Otherwise, I send a note to the Editor-in-Chief recommending immediate rejection.\nThe project has been quite successful with little additional resource implications. The editorial staff (two members) have had to undertake some additional work in screening submissions and querying those they are unsure of, but they have enjoyed the work and they have acquired some new skills in assessing good clinical trial reporting. Most of the work ie explaining where in the document key items have been reported, is pushed back to the authors. The authors are highly motivated to do this as they know that the manuscript will not be processed further until they have met these requirements (which are clearly placed on the journal’s online author instructions). Whilst it is true that the JID publishes few trials, those that are published are of high quality.\nOn a personal level, the project has been good fun, and has meant little additional work to my role as section editor with responsibilities for clinical trials. In fact, it has made my job of checking manuscripts much easier as I can quickly see where on the manuscript the key CONSORT items are meant to be described. It is clear from some of the submissions that some authors have not heard about trial prospective trial registration. When queried, some authors try and register their trial retrospectively after the analysis has been carried out, which defies the purpose of registration. Such papers are returned by the Editor to the authors without further review. I hope this model of working with journal editorial staff teams can help other journals improve reporting of trials in an efficient way. The key ingredients are (i) a committed journal editor (ii) editorial staff willing to take on new roles and (iii) a section editor with an interest in clinical trials to take responsibility for being arbiter for checks and borderline decisions."

    "text": "Jason Roberts, PhD is Managing Editor, Headache\nEdited by John Rothrock, MD and publishing 10 times a year, Headache is the official publication of the American Headache Society. It receives several hundred manuscripts annually, with roughly 35% of submissions arriving, respectively, from both North America and Europe. Roughly 60% of submissions report clinical trials, multi-patient case series or constitute a systematic overview. The majority of content is of a clinical nature but a small proportion of papers are oriented towards the basic sciences. The journal has an Impact Factor that places it just inside the top-third of titles ranked by ISI within Clinical Neurology. In short, it is a typical mid-sized journal.\nDuring 2008, the Headache editorial office undertook a critique of its publishing output over the previous decade. We found several cases of otherwise good papers that had failed to report research methodologies satisfactorily or omitted crucial information that hindered study replication. While this review of previously published material was ongoing, we also began to experience a surge in the volume of submissions. Nearly one-third of 2008 submissions were from authors new to Headache. Unfortunately, it seemed a sizeable proportion of these new papers contained weak methodological reporting (often to the detriment of otherwise interesting research).\nIn an effort to elevate the quality of material Headache published, we decided to overhaul our submission and peer review processes. An aggressive stance was taken: we would ask authors to work harder to improve the quality of their reporting. We also renewed a commitment to our authors to burnish potentially interesting papers. To achieve these twin objectives, we decided to mandate the inclusion of a reporting checklist for all submissions. We hoped the guidelines would compel authors to include pertinent methodological details that in turn would deliver a more uniform standard of reporting across manuscripts. Completion of the checklists would then serve to document where critical reporting elements were recorded in a manuscript, which would assist manuscript evaluation. The provision of reporting guidelines would have the dual purpose of making it clear to authors what the minimum threshold was for publication and aid our reviewers/editorial board in enforcing these standards as part of the peer review process. We took to heart the entreaty of Doug Altman, that though responsibility for good reporting rests with authors, journals have a role to play.\n\nLaunching an Effort to Collect Reporting Checklists\nTo institute this new policy, the editorial office was charged with three tasks: establish which checklists could be employed (step 1); devise a method of collection (step 2) and educate our author base of the benefits of utilizing checklists (step 3).\n\nStep 1\nSome reporting guidelines were well known to us (CONSORT, STARD) but we needed to explore the full range of options. This led us to EQUATOR. EQUATOR’s site was especially useful during this formative stage because it contained a tremendous depth of material from the checklists themselves through to editorials from journals that had already implemented reporting procedures. In reviewing established guidelines we determined 8 were of importance to us (see table 1).\n\n\nStep 2\nAfter selecting the reporting guidelines to be used, the next challenge was to establish a method of collection to accommodate our desire to see guideline adherence and checklist completion as a mandatory exercise. Headache uses the Manuscript Central online submission system, but the challenges of collecting forms through the submission site are similar for other products, such as Editorial Manager, Benchpress and EES. A new step was to be inserted into the online submission process. Authors would identify their study type (for example, Randomized Controlled Pharmacotherapy trials, Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies). The submission system would then respond by providing the appropriate checklist for the author to download and complete (all forms are MS Word documents). The author then has to upload the completed form as part of their submission.\nThe system was re-engineered in such a way that submission was not possible until a checklist file was uploaded. As the Manuscript Central system did not have an inbuilt workflow template to handle our demands at that time, we had to work with the system programmers to have the system configured appropriately.\n\n\n\nStep 3\nAssociated with the launch of the checklist mandate was a program to educate our authors, reviewers and readers. Two editorial board members, upon the launch o f the new reporting policies, published an editorial outlining our official position:\n\nGood reports should contain a clear explanation of the study methods, describe statistical techniques in enough detail to allow verification of the results from original data, report all results, and interpret and present findings in a balanced and forthright way.\n\nAdditionally, the journal editorial office has developed a workshop to run at American Headache Society meetings that incorporates instruction on the benefits of utilizing reporting guidelines within a general conversation on how to write, and submit, a manuscript successfully.\nOur education efforts aim to ensure authors understand that completion of a reporting checklist is not the important task. Instead, it is ensuring the guidelines are used constructively to shape the construction of an article. There is a sense that some authors are not able to make that distinction and see the checklists as an administrative barrier to submission.\n\n\nBenefits of Instituting Reporting Guidelines\nAs only one year has passed since we mandated the reporting checklist requirement, we do not yet have sufficient data to report on the apparent success of the policy beyond anecdotal evidence. Our intentions in launching the policy were to: improve the quality of research reporting amongst the submissions we received; aid reviewers in their evaluation of a manuscript and assist the decision-making process. First and foremost, we wanted to ensure that every critical element involved in data collection, where appropriate, was documented in a manuscript and recorded on a checklist. We were realistic and understood that reporting guidelines per se may not improve the overall quality of the paper, but we contended that forcing authors to record critical information regarding data collection enabled us to better judge the scientific merit of the article. It is still too early to assess if authors recognize the benefits of reporting guidelines. We have been conscious of pitching the imposition of a reporting policy as an aid to improving an author’s submission and not an administrative task.\nThe consensus amongst editorial board members has been that the checklists are facilitating the peer review process – indeed there is early observational evidence to suggest the checklists themselves are shaping some of the reviews returned as some reviewers structure comments around issues raised in the reporting guidelines. Again, anecdotally, individual editorial board members reported several cases where they felt that following a round of revision, reporting guides had improved several papers by highlighting omissions of important information."

I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to include or how best to structure it all. My PhD supervisor suggested I use a reporting guideline, and they were a total game-changer. They gave me something concrete to work with—like a to-do list that helped me get past that initial block and start putting information down on the page.\nThe first time I used one, I found it a bit tricky. It felt like a lot to take in, and although it helped me jot down information, my manuscript felt really long and a bit disjointed. But then I realised I didn’t have to follow it rigidly like a script. It was just a starting point. Once I had the key information written out, I could decide how best to organise it to make the paper flow well. Some things worked better in a table, some in the main text, and I moved a few details into the supplementary materials. That flexibility made it feel much more manageable.\nI was also a bit nervous about being too transparent—especially when it came to discussing limitations. But I’ve come to realise that journals and reviewers (and my supervisor and viva assessors!) really value honesty and thoughtful reflection. It shows that you understand your work deeply and are engaging with it critically. Overall, using reporting guidelines has made me feel much more confident and in control of the writing process."

    "text": "Jane Doe – Experienced Researcher\nI first came across reporting guidelines when a journal asked me to complete a checklist at the point of submission. At the time, I found it a bit annoying—after spending weeks refining and polishing the manuscript, the idea of going back to adjust the structure or add missing details felt like frustrating red tape. I completed the checklist, of course, but it felt like a box-ticking exercise rather than something helpful.\nThe next time I wrote a paper, I decided to use the relevant reporting guideline right from the start—just to see if it made the process smoother. It turned out to be a really practical tool. Having a clear list of what information to include made it easier to draft the paper, and I found myself making fewer revisions later on. Over time, using guidelines has become second nature. I now refer to them not just when writing papers, but also when planning new studies, preparing funding applications, and writing protocols. By the time I get to the journal submission stage, completing the checklist is quick and reassuring—I already know I’ve covered what’s important.\nI also use reporting guidelines when teaching my students how to write. For researchers who are still developing their writing habits, these guidelines provide structure and clarity. They help demystify what’s expected and build a strong foundation for clear, transparent research communication. If you’re just starting out, I’d really encourage you to give them a try—not just at the end of your writing, but as a tool to guide you from the beginning. It’s made a big difference to my work"

I’ve instructed my editorial and peer review teams to check all submissions against the appropriate reporting guidelines, whether that’s CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, or another guideline. They use these guidelines to assess whether key information is present, clear, and transparent—such as how the study was conducted, who was involved, what interventions were used, and how outcomes were measured. We don’t expect every study to be perfect—research is complex, and limitations are inevitable—but we do expect authors to report their work fully and honestly. A clearly reported study, with a thoughtful discussion of its limitations, is far more valuable to the scientific community than one that hides its flaws. Reporting guidelines help ensure that published research can be understood, used, built upon, and cited—and that’s essential for real-world impact, and essential to maintaining our reputation as a leading journal."

Our role is to ensure that each manuscript meets a set of minimal standards before it’s passed on to the academic editor for peer review. These initial checks include confirming that ethical declarations are in place, the manuscript is properly structured, and—crucially—that it adheres to the appropriate reporting guidelines.\nWhen a reporting guideline is required, we expect authors to submit a completed checklist alongside their manuscript. To help maintain quality and consistency, our team typically selects a few items at random from the checklist and cross-checks them against the manuscript to ensure the information is actually there. If a checklist is missing or key information hasn’t been reported, we contact the authors and hold the submission until the issues are resolved.\nThese requirements aren’t meant to be obstacles—they’re in place to help ensure your research is clear, complete, and ready for peer review.

    "text": "June Doe – Peer reviewer and evidence synthesiser\nWhen I peer review manuscripts for journals, I always refer to reporting guidelines to check whether the study has been reported clearly and completely. These guidelines help me spot missing details—things like how the sample was selected, exactly what interventions were used, or how outcomes were measured. I also recommend reporting guidelines to junior colleagues who are new to peer reviewing—they’re a great way to structure your review and make sure you’re thorough. Although I always remind my colleagues that checking for adherence to a reporting guideline is only the first step of a good review. Information has to be present before you can consider the strengths and weaknesses of research.\nI ask authors to fill in those gaps, not just so I can properly assess the quality and validity of the research, but because I know those details matter to other people down the line. Even if something doesn’t seem essential for the initial peer review, including it helps ensure your work is usable, reproducible, and ultimately more impactful.\nFor example, I do a lot of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of health research. To do my job effectively, I need to be able to find relevant studies, understand exactly what was done, extract key information, and compare results across multiple papers. When articles are poorly reported — e.g., the intervention isn’t clearly defined, the patient group isn’t described, or key terms are missing from the title and abstract — it can be incredibly difficult to even locate them through database searches. If important details are vague or missing, I may have to exclude the study altogether because I can’t be confident about what was done or how it fits with the other evidence. That not only weakens the quality of the review, but also means the original study misses out on being cited or informing future research and policy. The research articles that are most useful to me are the ones where all the key information is clearly reported, limitations are acknowledged, and reporting guidelines have been followed. These are the studies I can include, cite, and build on—so they ultimately have more influence and impact."

    "text": "Ready to get started?\nDownload resources\n\n\n\nResearch Paradigm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of beliefs and assumptions that guide the research process. These commonly include positivist, post-positivist, constructivist or interpretivist, and critical theory. Qualitative research generally draws from a post-positivist or constructivist/interpretivist paradigm.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstruments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData collection instruments include (but are not limited to) interview or focus group guides, observational protocols and prompts for field notes, and data extraction or coding protocols for selection and analysis of documents, photographs, videos, or other artifacts”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA term drawn from quantitative research, bias technically means a systematic error, where a particular research finding deviates from a ‘true’ finding. This might come about through errors in the manner of interviewing, or by errors in sampling. In qualitative research this is a problematic concept, since by definition the qualitative researcher is part of the process, and all researchers are different. This human factor has been said to be both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of qualitative method. What can be done in commercial qualitative research, however, is to minimise obvious and avoidable sources of bias, for example by not confining all the fieldwork to one social group or geographic location, by taking steps to recognise the personal views of the researcher, (using techniques such as bracketing), and by working in teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling strategy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral sampling strategies are commonly used in qualitative research, although most fall under the umbrella of purposeful (or purposive) sampling.\n\n\nPurposeful sampling means that participants, documents, or events are selected for their relevance to the research question, based on guiding theory or experiences and assumptions of the researchers. Over the course of the research process, researchers may determine that additional or different participants, documents, or events should be included to address the research question.\n\n\nOther sampling techniques, such as theoretical sampling (seeking examples of theoretical constructs), snowball sampling (using study participants to identify additional participants who meet study criteria), and convenience sampling (including any volunteers with no or minimal criteria for inclusion) may be appropriate depending on the question and approach, so long as the authors provide explanation and justification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA qualitative “approach” is a general way of thinking about conducting qualitative research. It describes, either explicitly or implicitly, the purpose of the qualitative research, the role of the researcher(s), the stages of research, and the method of data analysis. Commonly used approaches include ethnography, grounded theory, case study, phenomenology, and narrative research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Collection Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). Data collection methods include (but are not limited to) interviews, focus groups, observations (direct or indirect via video), and review of written text, photographs, and other documents or materials. See {{&lt; meta items.data-collection-instruments.title &gt;}} for triangulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIterative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start and end dates for data collection and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scientific description of peoples and cultures with their customs, habits, and mutual differences.\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrounded theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA method consisting of a set of systematic, but flexible, guidelines for conducting inductive qualitative inquiry aimed toward theory construction. This method focuses squarely on the analytic phases of research, although both data collection and analysis inform and shape each other and are conducted in tandem.\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree of participation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if some participants were observed and interviewed and others only interviewed, or if some participants completed multiple interviews and others completed a single interview, these variations should be explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit of analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn qualitative research, the unit of analysis is not necessarily the same as the unit of sampling (e.g., individual participants or events). Instead, some approaches use specific events as the unit of analysis, such as mentions of a particular topic or experience, or observations of a particular behavior or phenomenon, while others use groups rather than individual group participants. This specification has implications for how the data are organized and analyzed as well as the inferences drawn from the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexivity refers to intentional, systematic consideration of the potential or actual effects of the researcher(s) on all aspects of the study process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transferability of a research finding is the extent to which it can be applied in other contexts and studies. It is thus equivalent to or a replacement for the terms generalizability and external validity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralizability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appropriate scope for generalization of the findings beyond the study (e.g., to other settings, populations, time periods, circumstances)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic findings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytic findings may include interpretations, inferences, narratives, themes, and models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency of specific themes or codes.",
