## Recommendations to help write up research clearly{#sec-what-are-rgs}

:::{.lead}
Your research will be used by people from different disciplines and backgrounds for decades to come. Reporting guidelines are community-created recommendations for describing what you did and what you found so that _everyone_ can understand, repeat, apply, and synthesise your work. Reporting guidelines make writing up research easier, and transparent research leads to better patient outcomes.

<!-- Reporting guidelines don't advise how to _do_ research, but how to describe it completely so it can be used by everyone. They can be used throughout your research journey: -->

### Writing manuscripts
Write confidently using a reporting guideline to quickly turn a blank page into a thorough and impactful manuscript.

### Checking manuscripts
Use a reporting checklist to ensure you have included everything. Many journals require completed checklists at submission.

### Writing applications
Reporting guidelines can help you write funding applications, ethics applications, and protocols, but they won't make design decisions for you!

## The EQUATOR Network

EQUATOR stands for Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research. 

Our mission is to improve the reliability and value of published health research literature by promoting transparent and accurate reporting and wider use of robust reporting guidelines. We are the first coordinated attempt to tackle the problems of inadequate reporting systematically and on a global scale.

We advance the work done by individual guideline development groups. We maintain a database of reporting guidelines, run [training courses](training.qmd) on how to write research articles, have resources for [publishers](https://www.equator-network.org/toolkits/using-guidelines-in-journals/), [peer reviewers](https://www.equator-network.org/toolkits/peer-reviewing-research/), and reporting guideline [developers](https://www.equator-network.org/toolkits/developing-a-reporting-guideline/).  

We have centers in the [UK](https://www.equator-network.org/about-us/uk-equator-centre/) (our head office), [Canada](https://www.equator-network.org/about-us/canadian-equator-centre/), [Australia](https://www.equator-network.org/about-us/australasian-equator-centre/), [France](https://www.equator-network.org/about-us/french-equator-centre/), and [China](http://www.equator-chinese.org/pages/en/index/index.html).
