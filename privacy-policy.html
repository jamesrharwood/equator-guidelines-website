<p>This policy (together with our <a href="./terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>) describes how we collect and use your personal data during your use of our site, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and associated data protection legislation. Where we refer in this policy to your ‘personal data’, we mean any recorded information that is about you and from which you can be identified. It does not include data where your identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
</section>
<section id="who-is-using-your-personal-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-is-using-your-personal-data">Who is using your personal data?</h2>

It will also be shared with the third parties described below. By visiting our site, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.</p>

<section id="types-of-data-we-collect-about-you" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-data-we-collect-about-you">Types of data we collect about you</h2>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="when-we-collect-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-we-collect-your-data">When we collect your data</h2>
<p>We will collect the vast majority of data about you when you use our site, correspond with us, subscribe to the EQUATOR Newsletter or other social media functions on our site.</p>
<p>When you visit our site, we may also automatically collect technical information about your visit from your computer. You can find out more information about this below.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-we-use-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-we-use-your-data">How we use your data</h2>
<p>We process your data for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with the newsletter services you have requested e.g.&nbsp;Users actively subscribe to our EQUATOR Newsletter, or the Librarian Network. This processing is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into a contract. Information processed for this purpose includes, your name and email address. We do this only where you have specifically indicated that you consent to receive such communications, for example, registering your name and email address and confirming subscription. You can withdraw your consent at any time by clicking unsubscribe in the email footer. In this event, we will stop any processing as soon as we can. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your withdrawal of consent and you may no longer be able to use the site in the same way you did before. We will not provide your data to other businesses so they can use it for marketing purposes.</li>
<li>For purposes arising from your use of this website, for example, to ensure that we understand who uses our site and how our site is used and to improve our site and ensure it is secure. This processing occurs because it is necessary to meet our legitimate interests in operating this website. Information processed for this purpose includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses. We will only use your data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another related reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will seek your consent to use it for that new purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we may process your data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
</section>
<section id="sharing-your-data-with-third-parties" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sharing-your-data-with-third-parties">Sharing your data with third parties</h2>
<p>We may share your data with third parties who provide services on our behalf, such as for administrative purposes and website hosting. All our third-party service providers are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your data in line with our policies. We do not allow them to use your data for their own purposes. We permit them to process your data only for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p>Where your data is shared with third parties, we will seek to share the minimum amount necessary.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-we-store-or-use-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-we-store-or-use-your-data">Where we store or use your data</h2>
<p>We store data collected by the website electronically. The data is stored on secure servers at University of Oxford.</p>
<p>There may be occasions when we transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for example, when we communicate with you using a cloud-based service provider that operates outside the EEA such as MailChimp. Such transfers will only take place if one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the country receiving the data is considered by the EU to provide an adequate level of data protection;</li>
<li>the organisation receiving the data is covered by an arrangement recognised by the EU as providing an adequate standard of data protection e.g.&nbsp;transfers to companies that are certified under the EU US Privacy Shield;</li>
<li>the transfer is governed by approved contractual clauses;</li>
<li>the transfer has your consent;</li>
<li>the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps requested by you prior to entering into that contract; or</li>
<li>the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract with another person, which is in your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to the website and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
</section>
<section id="third-party-websites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="third-party-websites">Third party websites</h2>
<p>Our site contains links to and from various third-party websites.

</section>
<section id="retaining-your-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="retaining-your-data">Retaining your data</h2>
<p>We will only retain your data for as long as we need it to fulfil our purposes, including any relating to legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
</section>
<section id="your-rights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-rights">Your rights</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your data (commonly known as a “subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of your data and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
<li>Request correction of your data. This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove your data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
<li>Object to processing of your data where we are relying on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. [You also have the right to object where we are processing your data for direct marketing purposes.]</li>
<li>Request the restriction of processing of your data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your data, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
<li>Request the transfer of your data to another party.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your data and it would not be possible to fulfil our legal obligations if we were to stop. However, where you have consented to the processing (for example, where you have asked us to contact you for marketing purposes) you can withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us at equator@csm.ox.ac.uk. In this event, we will stop the processing as soon as we can. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your withdrawal of consent and you may no longer be able to use the site in the same way as you did before.</p>
<p>If you want to exercise any of the rights described above or are dissatisfied with the way we have used your information, you should contact the University’s Information Compliance Team at data.protection@admin.ox.ac.uk. The same email address may be used to contact the University’s Data Protection Officer. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>
<p>If you remain dissatisfied, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office at https://ico.org.uk/concerns/.</p>

<p>An example would be when researchers conducted a case-control study examining whether exposure to diesel exhaust particles increases the risk of respiratory disease in underground miners. Cases included miners diagnosed with respiratory disease, while controls were miners without respiratory disease.

</div>
<div class="offcanvas-body">
<div><p>A meta-analysis is a statistical technique that amalgamates data from multiple studies to yield a single estimate of the effect size. This approach enhances precision and offers a more comprehensive understanding by integrating quantitative findings. Central to a meta-analysis is the evaluation of heterogeneity, which examines variations in study outcomes to ensure that differences in populations, interventions, or methodologies do not skew results. Techniques such as meta-regression or subgroup analysis are frequently employed to explore how various factors might influence the outcomes. This method is particularly effective when aiming to quantify the effect size, odds ratio, or risk ratio, providing a clearer numerical estimate that can significantly inform clinical or policy decisions.</p>
<h2>How Meta-analyses and Systematic Reviews Work Together</h2>
<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses function together, each complementing the other to provide a more robust understanding of research evidence. A systematic review meticulously gathers and evaluates all pertinent studies, establishing a solid foundation of qualitative and quantitative data. Within this framework, if the collected data exhibit sufficient homogeneity, a meta-analysis can be performed. This statistical synthesis allows for the integration of quantitative results from individual studies, producing a unified estimate of effect size. Techniques such as meta-regression or subgroup analysis may further refine these findings, elucidating how different variables impact the overall outcome. By combining these methodologies, researchers can achieve both a comprehensive narrative synthesis and a precise quantitative measure, enhancing the reliability and applicability of their conclusions. This integrated approach ensures that the findings are not only well-rounded but also statistically robust, providing greater confidence in the evidence base.</p>
<h2>Why Don't All Systematic Reviews Use a Meta-Analysis?</h2>
<p>Systematic reviews do not always have meta-analyses, due to variations in the data. For a meta-analysis to be viable, the data from different studies must be sufficiently similar, or homogeneous, in terms of design, population, and interventions. When the data shows significant heterogeneity, meaning there are considerable differences among the studies, combining them could lead to skewed or misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the quality of the included studies is critical; if the studies are of low methodological quality, merging their results could obscure true effects rather than explain them.</p></div>
