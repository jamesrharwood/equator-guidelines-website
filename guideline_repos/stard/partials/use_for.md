You can use {{< meta acronym >}} if you are writing up a study which evaluates a diagnostic test against a clinical reference standard, or a gold standard.

<!-- #TODO what about it you're not comparing it to a standard, but just against another test?  -->

You can also it to:

* write a proposal or protocol for a diagnostic accuracy study (use the items within the Introduction and Method sections).
* review the _reporting_ of a diagnostic accuracy study article, but not to appraise the quality of its design or conduct.
