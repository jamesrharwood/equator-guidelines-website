## What to write

Identification as a study of diagnostic accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy (such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or AUC).

## Explanation

When searching for relevant biomedical studies on a
certain topic, electronic databases such as MEDLINE and Embase are
indispensable. To facilitate retrieval of their article, authors can
explicitly identify it as a report of a diagnostic accuracy study. This
can be performed by using terms in the title and/or abstract that refer
to measures of diagnostic accuracy, such as 'sensitivity',
'specificity', 'positive predictive value', 'negative predictive value',
'area under the ROC curve (AUC)' or 'likelihood ratio'.

In 1991, MEDLINE introduced a specific keyword (MeSH heading) for
indexing diagnostic studies: 'Sensitivity and Specificity.'
Unfortunately, the sensitivity of using this particular MeSH heading to
identify diagnostic accuracy studies can be as low as 51%.[@R13] As of
May 2015, Embase\'s thesaurus (Emtree) has 38 check tags for study
types; 'diagnostic test accuracy study' is one of them, but was only
introduced in 2011.

*In the example*, the authors mentioned the terms 'sensitivity' and
'specificity' in the abstract. The article will now be retrieved when
using one of these terms in a search strategy, and will be easily
identifiable as one describing a diagnostic accuracy study.

advanced adenoma or colorectal cancer) 6â€…mm or larger'.[@R12]
