## What to write

Study objectives and hypotheses.

## Explanation

Clinical studies may have a general aim (a long-term
goal, such as 'to improve the staging of oesophageal cancer'), specific
objectives (well-defined goals for this particular study) and testable
hypotheses (statements than can be falsified by the study results).

In diagnostic accuracy studies, statistical hypotheses are typically
defined in terms of acceptability criteria for single tests (minimum
levels of sensitivity, specificity or other measures). In those cases,
hypotheses generally include a quantitative expression of the expected
value of the diagnostic parameter. In other cases, statistical
hypotheses are defined in terms of equality or non-inferiority in
accuracy when comparing two or more index tests.

A priori specification of the study hypotheses limits the chances of
post hoc data-dredging with spurious findings, premature conclusions
about the performance of tests or subjective judgement about the
accuracy of the test. Objectives and hypotheses also guide sample size
calculations. An evaluation of 126 reports of diagnostic test accuracy
studies published in high-impact journals in 2010 revealed that 88% did
not state a clear hypothesis.[@R22]

*In the first example*, the authors\' objective was to evaluate the
accuracy of three diagnostic strategies; their specific hypothesis was
that the sensitivity of any of these would exceed the prespecified value
of 95%. *In the second example*, the authors explicitly describe the
hypotheses they want to explore in their study. The first hypothesis is
about the comparative sensitivity of two index tests (rapid antigen
detection test vs culture performed in physician office laboratories);
the second is about variability of rapid test performance according to
patient characteristics (spectrum bias).

## Examples

> 'The objective of this study was to evaluate the
sensitivity and specificity of 3 different diagnostic strategies: a
single rapid antigen test, a rapid antigen test with a follow-up rapid
antigen test if negative (rapid-rapid diagnostic strategy), and a rapid
antigen test with follow-up culture if negative (rapid-culture)---the
AAP diagnostic strategy---all compared with a 2-plate culture gold
standard. In addition, [...] we also compared the ability of these
strategies to achieve an absolute diagnostic test sensitivity of
\>95%'.[@R20]

> 'Our 2 main hypotheses were that rapid antigen
detection tests performed in physician office laboratories are more
sensitive than blood agar plate cultures performed and interpreted in
physician office laboratories, when each test is compared with a
simultaneous blood agar plate culture processed and interpreted in a
hospital laboratory, and rapid antigen detection test sensitivity is
subject to spectrum bias'.[@R21]
