## What to write

Structured summary of study design, methods, results and conclusions (for specific guidance, see STARD for Abstracts).

## Explanation

Readers use abstracts to decide whether they should
retrieve the full study report and invest time in reading it. In cases
where access to the full study report cannot be obtained or where time
is limited, it is conceivable that clinical decisions are based on the
information provided in abstracts only.

In two recent literature surveys, abstracts of diagnostic accuracy
studies published in high-impact journals or presented at an
international scientific conference were found insufficiently
informative, because key information about the research question, study
methods, study results and the implications of findings were frequently
missing.[@R14; @R15

Informative abstracts help readers to quickly appraise critical elements
of study validity (risk of bias) and applicability of study findings to
their clinical setting (generalisability). Structured abstracts, with
separate headings for objectives, methods, results and interpretation,
allow readers to find essential information more easily.[@R16]

Building on STARD 2015, the newly developed [STARD for Abstracts](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/stard-abstracts/) provides
a list of essential items that should be included in journal and
conference abstracts of diagnostic accuracy studies.
