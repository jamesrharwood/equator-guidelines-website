## What to write

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.

## Explanation

The diagnostic accuracy of a test can depend on the
demographic and clinical characteristics of the population in which it
is applied.[@R2; @R3; @R88] These differences may reflect variability
in the extent or severity of disease, which affects sensitivity, or in
the alternative conditions that are able to generate false-positive
findings, affecting specificity.[@R85]

An adequate description of the demographic and clinical characteristics
of study participants allows the reader to judge whether the study can
adequately address the study question, and whether the study findings
apply to the reader\'s clinical question.

*In the example*, the authors presented the demographic and clinical
characteristics of the study participants in a separate table, a
commonly used, informative way of presenting key participant
characteristics (@tbl-3).

## Example

> 'The median age of participants was 60 years (range
18--91), and 209 participants (54.7%) were female. The predominant
presenting symptom was abdominal pain, followed by rectal bleeding and
diarrhea, whereas fever and weight loss were less frequent. At physical
examination, palpation elicited abdominal pain in almost half the
patients, but palpable abdominal or rectal mass was found in only 13
individuals (Table X)'.[@R87] (See @tbl-3.)
