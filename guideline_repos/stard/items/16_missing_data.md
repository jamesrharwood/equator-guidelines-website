## What to write

How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled.

## Explanation

Missing data are common in any type of biomedical
research. In diagnostic accuracy studies, they can occur for the index
test and reference standard. There are several ways to deal with them
when analysing the data.[@R68] Many researchers exclude participants
without an observed test result. This is known as 'complete case' or
'available case' analysis. This may lead to a loss in precision and can
introduce bias, especially if having a missing index test or reference
standard result is related to having the target condition.

Participants with missing test results can be included in the analysis
if missing results are imputed.[@R68] Another option is to assess the
impact of missing test results on estimates of accuracy by considering
different scenarios. For the index test, for example, in the 'worst-case
scenario', all missing index test results are considered false-positive
or false-negative depending on the reference standard result; in the
'best-case scenario', all missing index test results are considered
true-positive or true-negative.

*In the example*, the authors explicitly reported how many cases with
missing index test data they encountered and how they handled these
data: they excluded them, but also applied a 'worst-case scenario'.

## Example

> 'One vessel had missing FFR~CT~ and 2 had missing CT data.
Missing data were handled by exclusion of these vessels as well as by
the worst-case imputation'.[@R67]
