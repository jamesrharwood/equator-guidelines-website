## What to write

Whether participants formed a consecutive, random or convenience series.

## Explanation

The included study participants may be either a
consecutive series of all patients evaluated for eligibility at the
study location and satisfying the inclusion criteria, or a subselection
of these. A subselection can be purely random, produced by using a
random numbers table, or less random, if patients are only enrolled on
specific days or during specific office hours. In that case, included
participants may not be considered a representative sample of the
targeted population, and the generalisability of the study results may
be jeopardised.[@R2; @R29]

In the example, the authors explicitly described a convenience series
where participants were enrolled based on their accessibility to the
clinical investigator.

## Example

> 'All subjects were evaluated and screened for study
eligibility by the first author (E.N.E.) prior to study entry. This was
a convenience sample of children with pharyngitis; the subjects were
enrolled when the first author was present in the emergency
department'.[@R37]
