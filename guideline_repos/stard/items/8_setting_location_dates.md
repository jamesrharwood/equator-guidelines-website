## What to write

Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location and dates).

## Explanation

The results of a diagnostic accuracy study reflect the
performance of a test in a particular clinical context and setting. A
medical test may perform differently in a primary, secondary or tertiary
care setting, for example. Authors should therefore report the actual
setting in which the study was performed, as well as the exact
locations: names of the participating centres, city and country. The
spectrum of the target condition as well as the range of other
conditions that occur in patients suspected of the target condition can
vary across settings, depending on which referral mechanisms are in
play.[@R34]

Since test procedures, referral mechanisms and the prevalence and
severity of diseases can evolve over time, authors should also report
the start and end dates of participant recruitment.

This information is essential for readers who want to evaluate the
generalisability of the study findings, and their applicability to
specific questions, for those who would like to use the evidence
generated by the study to make informed healthcare decisions.

*In the example*, study setting and study dates were clearly defined.

## Example

> 'The study was conducted at the Emergency Department of a
university-affiliated children\'s hospital between January 21, 1996, and
April 30, 1996'.[@R33]
