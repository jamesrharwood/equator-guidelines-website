## What to write

Registration number and name of registry.

## Explanation

Registering study protocols before their initiation in
a clinical trial registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov or one of the WHO
Primary Registries, ensures that existence of the studies can be
identified.[@R108] This has many advantages, including avoiding
overlapping or redundant studies, and allowing colleagues and potential
participants to contact the study coordinators.

Additional benefits of study registration are the prospective definition
of study objectives, outcome measures, eligibility criteria and data to
be collected, allowing editors, reviewers and readers to identify
deviations in the final study report. Trial registration also allows
reviewers to identify studies that have been completed but were not yet
reported.

Many journals require registration of clinical trials. A low but
increasing number of diagnostic accuracy studies are also being
registered. In a recent evaluation of 351 test accuracy studies
published in high-impact journals in 2012, 15% had been
registered.[@R113]

Including a registration number in the study report facilitates
identification of the trial in the corresponding registry. It can also
be regarded as a sign of quality, if the trial was registered before its
initiation.

*In the example*, the authors reported that the study was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov. The registration number was also provided, so that
the registered record could be easily retrieved.
