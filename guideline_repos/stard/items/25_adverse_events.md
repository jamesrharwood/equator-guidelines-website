## What to write

Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard.

## Explanation

Not all medical tests are equally safe, and in this,
they do not differ from many other medical interventions.[@R99; @R100]
The testing procedure can lead to complications, such as perforations
with endoscopy, contrast allergic reactions in CT imaging or
claustrophobia with MRI scanning.

Measuring and reporting of adverse events in studies of diagnostic
accuracy will provide additional information to clinicians, who may be
reluctant to use them if they produce severe or frequent adverse events.
Actual application of a test in clinical practice will not just be
guided by the test\'s accuracy, but by several other dimensions as well,
including feasibility and safety. This also applies to the reference
standard.

*In the example*, the authors distinguished between 'significant' and
'minor' adverse events, and explicitly reported how often these were
observed.

## Example

> 'No significant adverse events occurred as a result of
colonoscopy. Four (2%) patients had minor bleeding in association with
polypectomy that was controlled endoscopically. Other minor adverse
events are noted in the appendix'.[@R79]
