title: "7. Identifying eligible participants"

## What to write

On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry).

## Explanation

The eligibility criteria specify who can participate in
the study, but they do not describe how the study authors identified
eligible participants. This can be performed in various ways.[@R30] A
general practitioner may evaluate every patient for eligibility that he
sees during office hours. Researchers can go through registries in an
emergency department, to identify potentially eligible patients. In
other studies, patients are only identified after having been subjected
to the index test. Still other studies start with patients in whom the
reference standard was performed. Many retrospective studies include
participants based on searching hospital databases for patients that
underwent the index test and the reference standard.[@R31]

Differences in methods for identifying eligible patients can affect the
spectrum and prevalence of the target condition in the study group, as
well as the range and relative frequency of alternative conditions in
patients without the target condition.[@R32] These differences can
influence the estimates of diagnostic accuracy.

*In the example*, participants were identified through searching a
patient database and were included if they underwent the index test and
the reference standard.
