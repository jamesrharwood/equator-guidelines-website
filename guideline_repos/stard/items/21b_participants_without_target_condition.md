## What to write

Distribution of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition

## Explanation

(NB The explanation and example for items 21a and 21b are the same.)

Most target conditions are not fixed states, either
present or absent; many diseases cover a continuum, ranging from minute
pathological changes to advanced clinical disease. Test sensitivity is
often higher in studies in which more patients have advanced stages of
the target condition, as these cases are often easier to identify by the
index test.[@R28; @R85] The type, spectrum and frequency of alternative
diagnoses in those without the target condition may also influence test
accuracy; typically, the healthier the patients without the target
condition, the less frequently one would find false-positive results of
the index test.[@R28]

An adequate description of the severity of disease in those with the
target condition and of the alternative conditions in those without it
allows the reader to judge both the validity of the study, relative to
the study question and the applicability of the study findings to the
reader\'s clinical question.

*In the example*, the authors investigated the accuracy of exercise
tests for diagnosing coronary artery disease. They reported the
distribution of severity of disease in terms of the number of vessels
involved; the more vessels, the more severe the coronary artery disease
would be. Sensitivity of test exercises was higher in those with more
diseased vessels (39% for single vessel disease, 58% for two and 77% for
three vessels).[@R91]

## Example

> 'Of the 170 patients with coronary disease, one had left
main disease, 53 had three vessel disease, 64 two vessel disease, and 52
single vessel disease. The mean ejection fraction of the patients with
coronary disease was 64% (range 37--83). The other 52 men with symptoms
had normal coronary arteries or no significant lesions at
angiography'.[@R93]
