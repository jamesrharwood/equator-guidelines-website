title: "23. Index test and reference standard results"

## What to write

Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard.

## Explanation

Research findings should be reproducible and verifiable
by other scientists; this applies both to the testing procedures, to the
conduct of the study and to the statistical analyses.

A cross tabulation of index test results against reference standard
results facilitates recalculating measures of diagnostic accuracy. It
also facilitates recalculating the proportion of study group
participants with the target condition, which is useful as the
sensitivity and specificity of a test may vary with disease
prevalence.[@R32; @R96] It also allows for performing alternative or
additional analyses, such as meta-analysis.

Preferably, such tables should include actual numbers, not just
percentages, because mistakes made by study authors in calculating
estimates for sensitivity and specificity are not rare.

*In the example*, the authors provided a contingency table from which
the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives and true
negatives can be easily identified (@tbl-app).
