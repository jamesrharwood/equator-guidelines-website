## What to write

Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist).

## Explanation

In diagnostic accuracy studies, the reference standard
is used for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition
in study participants. Several reference standards may be available to
define the same target condition. In such cases, authors are invited to
provide their rationale for selecting the specific reference standard
from the available alternatives. This may depend on the intended use of
the index test, the clinical relevance or practical and/or ethical
reasons.

Alternative reference standards are not always in perfect agreement.
Some reference standards are less accurate than others. In other cases,
different reference standards reflect related but different
manifestations or stages of the disease, as in confirmation by imaging
(first reference standard) versus clinical events (second reference
standard).

*In the example*, the authors selected the MINI, a structured diagnostic
interview commonly used for psychiatric evaluations, as the reference
standard for identifying depression and suicide risk in adults with
epilepsy. As a rationale for their choice, they claimed that the MINI
test was short to administer, efficient for clinical and research
purposes, reliable and valid when compared with alternative diagnostic
interviews.

## Example

> 'The MINI [Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory]
was developed as a short and efficient diagnostic interview to be used
in both research and clinical settings *(reference supporting this
statement provided by the authors)*. It has good reliability and
validity rates compared with other gold standard diagnostic interviews,
such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM [Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] Disorders (SCID) and the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview *(references supporting
this statement provided by the authors)*'.[@R46]
