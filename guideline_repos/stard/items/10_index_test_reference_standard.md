        10a. Index test

        10b. Reference standard
---
## What to write

10a. Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication.

10b. Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication

## Explanation

Differences in the execution of the index test or
reference standard are a potential source of variation in diagnostic
accuracy.[@R39; @R40] Authors should therefore describe the methods for
executing the index test and reference standard, in sufficient detail to
allow other researchers to replicate the study, and to allow readers to
assess (1) the feasibility of using the index test in their own setting,
(2) the adequacy of the reference standard and (3) the applicability of
the results to their clinical question.

The description should cover key elements of the test protocol,
including details of:

A.  the preanalytical phase, for example, patient preparation such as
    fasting/feeding status prior to blood sampling, the handling of the
    sample prior to testing and its limitations (such as sample
    instability), or the anatomic site of measurement;

B.  the analytical phase, including materials and instruments and
    analytical procedures;

C.  the postanalytical phase, such as calculations of risk scores using
    analytical results and other variables.

Between-study variability in measures of test accuracy due to
differences in test protocol has been documented for a number of tests,
including the use of hyperventilation prior to exercise ECG and the use
of tomography for exercise thallium scintigraphy.[@R27; @R40]

The number, training and expertise of the persons executing and reading
the index test and the reference standard may also be critical. Many
studies have shown between-reader variability, especially in the field
of imaging.[@R41; @R42] The quality of reading has also been shown to
be affected in cytology and microbiology by professional background,
expertise and prior training to improve interpretation and to reduce
interobserver variation.[@R43] Information about the amount of training
of the persons in the study who read the index test can help readers to
judge whether similar results are achievable in their own settings.

In some cases, a study depends on multiple reference standards. Patients
with lesions on an imaging test under evaluation may, for example,
undergo biopsy with a final diagnosis based on histology, whereas
patients without lesions on the index test undergo clinical follow-up as
reference standard. This could be a potential source of bias, so authors
should specify which patient groups received which reference
standard.[@R2; @R3]

More specific guidance for specialised fields of testing, or certain
types of tests, will be developed in future STARD extensions. Whenever
available, these extensions will be made available on the STARD pages at
the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research)
website (<http://www.equator-network.org/>).

*In the example*, the authors described how blood samples were collected
and processed in the laboratory. They also report analytical performance
characteristics of the index test device, as obtained in previous
studies.

## Example

> 'An intravenous line was inserted in an antecubital vein
and blood samples were collected into serum tubes before (baseline),
immediately after, and 1.5 and 4.5 h after stress testing. Blood samples
were put on ice, processed within 1 h of collection, and later stored at
−80°C before analysis. The samples had been through 1 thaw--freeze cycle
before cardiac troponin I (cTnI) analysis. We measured cTnI by a
prototype hs assay (ARCHITECT *STAT* high-sensitivity troponin, Abbott
Diagnostics) with the capture antibody detecting epitopes 24--40 and the
detection antibody epitopes 41--49 of cTnI. The limit of detection (LoD)
for the high sensitivity (hs) cTnI assay was recently reported by other
groups to be 1.2 ng/L, the 99th percentile 16 ng/L, and the assay 10%
coefficient of variation (CV) 3.0 ng/L. [...] Samples with
concentrations below the range of the assays were assigned values of 1.2
[...] for cTnI. [...]'.[@R38]
