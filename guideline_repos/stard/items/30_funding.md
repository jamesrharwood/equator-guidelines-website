## What to write

Sources of funding and other support; role of funders.

## Explanation

Sponsorship of a study by a pharmaceutical company has
been shown to be associated with results favouring the interests of that
sponsor.[@R117] Unfortunately, sponsorship is often not disclosed in
scientific articles, making it difficult to assess this potential bias.
Sponsorship can consist of direct funding of the study, or of the
provision of essential study materials, such as test devices.

The role of the sponsor, including the degree to which that sponsor was
involved in the study, varies. A sponsor could, for example, be involved
in the design of the study, but also in the conduct, analysis, reporting
and decision to publish. Authors are encouraged to be explicit about
sources of funding as well as the sponsors role(s) in the study, as this
transparency helps readers to appreciate the level of independency of
the researchers.

*In the example*, the authors were explicit about the contribution from
the sponsor, and their independence in each phase of the study.

The authors thank the STARD Group for helping us in identifying
essential items for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies.

## Example

> 'Funding, in the form of the extra diagnostic reagents and
equipment needed for the study, was provided by Gen-Probe. The funders
had no role in the initiation or design of the study, collection of
samples, analysis, interpretation of data, writing of the paper, or the
submission for publication. The study and researchers are independent of
the funders, Gen-Probe'.[@R116]
