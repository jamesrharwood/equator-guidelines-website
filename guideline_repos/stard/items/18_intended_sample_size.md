## What to write

Intended sample size and how it was determined.

## Explanation

Performing sample size calculations when developing a
diagnostic accuracy study may ensure that a sufficient amount of
precision is reached. Sample size calculations also take into account
the specific objectives and hypotheses of the study.

Readers may want to know how the sample size was determined, and whether
the assumptions made in this calculation are in line with the scientific
and clinical background, and the study objectives. Readers will also
want to learn whether the study authors were successful in recruiting
the targeted number of participants. Methods for performing sample size
calculations in diagnostic research are widely available,[@R74] but such
calculations are not always performed or provided in reports of
diagnostic accuracy studies.[@R77; @R78]

Many diagnostic accuracy studies are small; a systematic survey of
studies published in 8 leading journals in 2002 found a median sample
size of 118 participants (IQR 71--350).[@R77] Estimates of diagnostic
accuracy from small studies tend to be imprecise, with wide CIs around
them.

*In the example*, the authors reported in detail to achieve a desired
level of precision for an expected sensitivity of 80%.

## Example

> 'Study recruitment was guided by an expected 12% prevalence
of adenomas 6â€…mm or larger in a screening cohort and a point estimate of
80% sensitivity for these target lesions. We planned to recruit
approximately 600 participants to achieve margins of sampling error of
approximately 8 percentage points for sensitivity. This sample would
also allow 90% power to detect differences in sensitivity between
computed tomographic colonography and optical colonoscopy of 18
percentage points or more'.[@R73]
