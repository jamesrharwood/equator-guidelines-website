## What to write

Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing prespecified from exploratory.

## Explanation

The relative proportion of false-positive or
false-negative results of a diagnostic test may vary depending on
patient characteristics, experience of readers, the setting and previous
test results.[@R2; @R3] Researchers may therefore want to explore
possible sources of variability in test accuracy within their study. In
such analyses, investigators typically assess differences in accuracy
across subgroups of participants, readers or centres.

Post hoc analyses, performed after looking at the data, carry a high
risk for spurious findings. The results are especially likely not to be
confirmed by subsequent studies. Analyses that were prespecified in the
protocol, before data were collected, have greater credibility.[@R72]

*In the example*, the authors reported that the accuracy of the urinary
indices was evaluated in two subgroups that were explicitly
prespecified.

## Example

> 'To assess the performance of urinary indices or their
changes over the first 24â€…hours in distinguishing transient AKI [acute
kidney injury] from persistent AKI, we plotted the receiver-operating
characteristic curves for the proportion of true positives against the
proportion of false positives, depending on the prediction rule used to
classify patients as having persistent AKI. The same strategy was used
to assess the performance of indices and their changes over time in two
predefined patient subgroups; namely, patients who did not receive
diuretic therapy and patients without sepsis'.[@R71]
