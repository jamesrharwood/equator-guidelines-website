title: "24. Estimates of accuracy"

## What to write

Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% CIs).

## Explanation

Diagnostic accuracy studies never determine a test\'s
'true' sensitivity and specificity; at best, the data collected in the
study can be used to calculate valid estimates of sensitivity and
specificity. The smaller the number of study participants, the less
precise these estimates will be.[@R98]

The most frequently used expression of imprecision is to report not just
the estimates---sometimes referred to as point estimates---but also 95%
CIs around the estimates. Results from studies with imprecise estimates
of accuracy should be interpreted with caution, as overoptimism
lurks.[@R22]

*In the example*, where MRI is the index test and CT the reference
standard, the authors reported point estimates and 95% CIs around them,
for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value.

## Example

> 'Forty-six patients had pulmonary fibrosis at CT, and
sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging in the identification of
pulmonary fibrosis were 89% (95% CI 77%, 96%) and 91% (95% CI 76%, 98%),
respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 93% (95%
CI 82%, 99%) and 86% (95% CI 70%, 95%), respectively'.[@R97]
