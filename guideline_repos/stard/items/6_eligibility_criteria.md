## What to write

Eligibility criteria.

## Explanation

Since a diagnostic accuracy study describes the
behaviour of a test under particular circumstances, a report of the
study must include a complete description of the criteria that were used
to identify eligible participants. Eligibility criteria are usually
related to the nature and stage of the target condition and the intended
future use of the index test; they often include the signs, symptoms or
previous test results that generate the suspicion about the target
condition. Additional criteria can be used to exclude participants for
reasons of safety, feasibility and ethical arguments.

Excluding patients with a specific condition or receiving a specific
treatment known to adversely affect the way the test works can lead to
inflated diagnostic accuracy estimates.[@R27] An example is the
exclusion of patients using β blockers in studies evaluating the
diagnostic accuracy of exercise ECG.

Some studies have one set of eligibility criteria for all study
participants; these are sometimes referred to as single-gate or cohort
studies. Other studies have one set of eligibility criteria for
participants with the target condition, and (an)other set(s) of
eligibility criteria for those without the target condition; these are
called multiple-gate or case--control studies.[@R28]

*In the first example*, the eligibility criteria list presenting signs
and symptoms, an age limit and exclusion based on specific conditions
and treatments. Since the same set of eligibility criteria applies to
all study participants, this is an example of a single-gate study.

*In the second example*, the authors used different eligibility criteria
for participants with and without the target condition: one group
consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of *Clostridium
difficile*, and one group consisted of healthy controls. This is an
example of a multiple-gate study. Extreme contrasts between severe cases
and healthy controls can lead to inflated estimates of accuracy.[@R6]

## Examples

> 'Patients eligible for inclusion were consecutive
adults (≥18 years) with suspected pulmonary embolism, based on the
presence of at least one of the following symptoms: unexplained (sudden)
dyspnoea, deterioration of existing dyspnoea, pain on inspiration, or
unexplained cough. We excluded patients if they received anticoagulant
treatment (vitamin K antagonists or heparin) at presentation, they were
pregnant, follow-up was not possible, or they were unwilling or unable
to provide written informed consent'.[@R25]

> 'Eligible cases had symptoms of diarrhoea and both a
positive result for toxin by enzyme immunoassay and a toxigenic *C
difficile* strain detected by culture (in a sample taken less than seven
days before the detection round). We defined diarrhoea as three or more
loose or watery stool passages a day. We excluded children and adults on
intensive care units or haematology wards. Patients with a first relapse
after completing treatment for a previous *C difficile* infection were
eligible but not those with subsequent relapses. [...] For each case
we approached nine control patients. These patients were on the same
ward as and in close proximity to the index patient. Control patients
did not have diarrhoea, or had diarrhoea but a negative result for *C
difficile* toxin by enzyme immunoassay and culture (in a sample taken
less than seven days previously)'.[@R26]
