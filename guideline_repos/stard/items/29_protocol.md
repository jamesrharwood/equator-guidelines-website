## What to write

Where the full study protocol can be accessed.

## Explanation

Full study protocols typically contain additional
methodological information that is not provided in the final study
report, because of word limits, or because it has been reported
elsewhere. This additional information can be helpful for those who want
to thoroughly appraise the validity of the study, for researchers who
want to replicate the study and for practitioners who want to implement
the testing procedures.

An increasing number of researchers share their original study protocol,
often before enrolment of the first participant in the study. They may
do so by publishing the protocol in a scientific journal, at an
institutional or sponsor website, or as supplementary material on the
journal website, to accompany the study report.

If the protocol has been published or posted online, authors should
provide a reference or a link. If the study protocol has not been
published, authors should state from whom it can be obtained.[@R115]

*In the example*, the authors provided a reference to the full protocol,
which had been published previously.

## Example

> 'The design and rationale of the OPTIMAP study have been
previously published in more detail [with reference to study
protocol]'.[@R114]
