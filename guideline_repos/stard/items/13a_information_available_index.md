title: "13a. Information available to performers or readers of the index test"

## What to write

Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers or readers of the index test.

## Example

> 'Images for each patient were reviewed by two
fellowship-trained genitourinary radiologists with 12 and 8â€…years of
experience, respectively, who were blinded to all patient information,
including the final histopathologic diagnosis'.[@R52]

## Explanation

(NB the explanation and example for items 13a and 13b are the same.)

Some medical tests, such as most forms of imaging,
require human handling, interpretation and judgement. These actions may
be influenced by the information that is available to the reader.[@R1]
[@R53; @R54] This can lead to artificially high agreement between
tests, or between the index test and the reference standard.

If the reader of a test has access to information about signs, symptoms
and previous test results, the reading may be influenced by this
additional information, but this may still represent how the test is
used in clinical practice.[@R2] The reverse may also apply, if the
reader does not have enough information for a proper interpretation of
the index test outcome. In that case, test performance may be affected
downwards, and the study findings may have limited applicability. Either
way, readers of the study report should know to which extent, such
additional information was available to test readers and may have
influenced their final judgement.

In other situations, the assessors of the reference standard may have
had access to the index test results. In those cases, the final
classification may be guided by the index test result, and the reported
accuracy estimates for the index test will be too high.[@R1; @R2]
[@R27] Tests that require subjective interpretation are particularly
susceptible to this bias.

Withholding information from the readers of the test is commonly
referred to as 'blinding' or 'masking'. The point of this reporting item
is not that blinding is desirable or undesirable, but, rather, that
readers of the study report need information about blinding for the
index test and the reference standard to be able to interpret the study
findings.

*In the example*, the readers of unenhanced CT for differentiating
between renal angiomyolipoma and renal cell carcinoma did not have
access to clinical information, nor to the results of histopathology,
the reference standard in this study.
