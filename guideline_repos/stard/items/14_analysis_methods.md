## What to write

Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy.

## Explanation

Multiple measures of diagnostic accuracy exist to
describe the performance of a medical test, and their calculation from
the collected data is not always straightforward.[@R56] Authors should
report the methods used for calculating the measures that they
considered appropriate for their study objectives.

Statistical techniques can be used to test specific hypotheses,
following from the study\'s objectives. In single-test evaluations,
authors may want to evaluate if the diagnostic accuracy of the tests
exceeds a prespecified level (eg, sensitivity of at least 95%, see Item
4).

Diagnostic accuracy studies can also compare two or more index tests. In
such comparisons, statistical hypothesis testing usually involves
assessing the superiority of one test over another, or the
non-inferiority.[@R57] For such comparisons, authors should indicate
what measure they specified to make the comparison; these should match
their study objectives, and the purpose and role of the index test
relative to the clinical pathway. Examples are the relative sensitivity,
the absolute gain in sensitivity and the relative diagnostic OR.[@R58]

*In the example*, the authors used McNemar\'s test statistic to evaluate
whether the sensitivity and specificity of stereoscopic digital
mammography differed from that of digital mammography in patients with
elevated risk for breast cancer. In itself, the resulting p value is not
a quantitative expression of the relative accuracy of the two
investigated tests. Like any p value, it is influenced by the magnitude
of the difference in effect and the sample size. In the example, the
authors could have calculated the relative or absolute difference in
sensitivity and specificity, including a 95% CI that takes into account
the paired nature of the data.

## Example

> 'Statistical tests of sensitivity and specificity were
conducted by using the McNemar test for correlated proportions. All
tests were two sided, testing the hypothesis that stereoscopic digital
mammography performance differed from that of digital mammography. A
p-value of 0.05 was considered as the threshold for significance'.[@R55]
