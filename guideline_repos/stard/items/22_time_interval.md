## What to write

Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard.

## Explanation

Studies of diagnostic accuracy are essentially
cross-sectional investigations. In most cases, one wants to know how
well the index test classified patients in the same way as the reference
standard, when both tests are performed in the same patients, at the
same time.[@R30] When a delay occurs between the index test and the
reference standard, the target condition and alternative conditions can
change; conditions may worsen, or improve in the meanwhile, due to the
natural course of the disease, or due to clinical interventions applied
between the two tests. Such changes influence the agreement between the
index test and the reference standard, which could lead to biased
estimates of test performance.

The bias can be more severe if the delay differs systematically between
test positives and test negatives, or between those with a high prior
suspicion of having the target condition and those with a low
suspicion.[@R1; @R2]

When follow-up is used as the reference standard, readers will want to
know how long the follow-up period was.

*In the example*, the authors reported the mean number of days, and a
range, between the index test and the reference standard.

## Example

> 'The mean time between arthrometric examination and MR
imaging was 38.2 days (range, 0--107 days)'.[@R94]
