## What to write

Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test.

## Explanation

To make the study findings relevant for practice,
authors of diagnostic accuracy studies should elaborate on the
consequences of their findings, taking into account the intended use
(the purpose of testing) and clinical role of the test (how will the
test be positioned in the existing clinical pathway).

A test can be proposed for diagnostic purposes, for susceptibility,
screening, risk stratification, staging, prediction, prognosis,
treatment selection, monitoring, surveillance or other purposes. The
clinical role of the test reflects its positioning relative to existing
tests for the same purpose, within the same clinical setting: triage,
add-on or replacement.[@R19; @R105] The intended use and the clinical
role of the index test should have been described in the introduction of
the paper (Item 3).

The intended use and the proposed role will guide the desired magnitude
of the measures of diagnostic accuracy. For ruling-out disease with an
inexpensive triage test, for example, high sensitivity is required, and
less-than-perfect specificity may be acceptable. If the test is supposed
to rule-in disease, specificity may become much more important.[@R106]

In the Discussion section, authors should elaborate on whether or not
the accuracy estimates are sufficient for considering the test to be
'fit for purpose'.

*In the example*, the authors concluded that the combination of a Wells
score ≤4 and a negative point-of-care D-dimer result could reliably
rule-out pulmonary embolism in a large proportion of patients seen in
primary care.

## Example

> 'A Wells score of ≤4 combined with a negative point of care
D-dimer test result ruled out pulmonary embolism in 4--5 of 10 patients,
with a failure rate of less than 2%, which is considered safe by most
published consensus statements. Such a rule-out strategy makes it
possible for primary care doctors to safely exclude pulmonary embolism
in a large proportion of patients suspected of having the condition,
thereby reducing the costs and burden to the patient (for example,
reducing the risk of contrast nephropathy associated with spiral
computed tomography) associated with an unnecessary referral to
secondary care'.[@R25]
