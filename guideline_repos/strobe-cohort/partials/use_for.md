**You can use STROBE-cohort if you're writing up research involving the observation of one or more groups of people (cohorts) over time**

You can also use this reporting guideline for:

* writing a proposal or protocol for a cohort study (use the items within the Introduction and Method sections).
* reviewing the _reporting_ of a cohort study article, but not for appraising its quality
