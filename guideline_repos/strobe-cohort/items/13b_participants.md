Give reasons for non-participation at each stage



## Read More

Explaining the reasons why people no longer participated in a study or why they were excluded from statistical analyses helps readers judge whether the study population was representative of the target population and whether bias was possibly introduced. For example, in a cross-sectional health survey, non-participation due to reasons unlikely to be related to health status (for example, the letter of invitation was not delivered because of an incorrect address) will affect the precision of estimates but will probably not introduce bias. Conversely, if many individuals opt out of the survey because of illness, or perceived good health, results may underestimate or overestimate the prevalence of ill health in the population

## Examples

> The main reasons for non-participation were the participant was too ill or had died before interview (cases 30%, controls < 1%), nonresponse (cases 2%, controls 21%), refusal (cases 10%, controls 29%), and other reasons (refusal by consultant or general practitioner, non-English speaking, mental impairment) (cases 7%, controls 5%)
