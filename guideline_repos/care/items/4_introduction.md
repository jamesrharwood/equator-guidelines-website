## What to write

Brief background summary of the case referencing the relevant medical literature.

## Explanation

The introduction provides context for the case report related to the patient's episode of care and may elaborate a demonstration of need. The most important studies may be cited to introduce readers to the topic; however, a detailed discussion of relevant studies—such as a comprehensive literature review accompanying the case report—is best left to the discussion section [@ref19; @ref26; @ref27]. We recommend that case reports following the CARE Guidelines should include the following statement: > "This case report was prepared following the CARE Guidelines" and include a citation of the CARE Statement publication. Referencing the guidelines informs the reader of the standards for reporting and facilitates the evaluation of the adherence to the guidelines [@ref28]. The introduction generally ends with a 1–3 sentence synopsis of the case that identifies a question and/or gap in knowledge, the importance of this patient case, and a single priority message [@ref20].

## Examples

> "A period of prolonged seated immobility is recognized as one of the major risk factors for developing venous thrombosis. Long-distance air travel and prolonged sitting in relation to work or recreation have been shown to increase the risk of venous thrombosis [@ref1; @ref2]. A recent survey has found that the average time spent playing video games is increasing and that gamers in the United States spend an average of 13 hours each week playing computer games [@ref3]. Prolonged immobility associated with gaming may therefore be an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism. We report a case of a 31-year-old man who developed extensive deep vein thrombosis associated with prolonged playing of PlayStation games."

> "Acquired T-cell defects are well known to occur in adults with untreated Hodgkin's disease, sarcoidosis, and viral infections. These noniatrogenic T-cell deficiencies are marked by cutaneous anergy and diminished proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens in vitro. Opportunistic infections rarely occur in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. We recently treated several young, previously healthy, homosexual men for multiple episodes of P. carinii pneumonia, extensive mucosal candidiasis, and severe viral infections. The clinical manifestations and studies of cellular immune function in these patients indicated a similar severe acquired T-cell defect. Several lines of evidence suggested that cytomegalovirus infection was a major factor in the pathogenesis of the immunocompromised state. This syndrome represents a potentially transmissible immune deficiency."
