## What to write

Did the patient give informed consent? Please provide if requested.

## Explanation

Informed consent is customarily required by medical journals. Whenever possible, obtain signed consent to write and publish the case report from the patient. Some cases may require additional consent (e.g., when potentially identifiable information is unavoidable, when the patient is older than 90 years of age in the United States, there is a photograph or image or has a rare disease).

In exceptional circumstances or if the patient is unable to provide consent, consent may be obtained from a close relative. For children who are too young to consent themselves, obtain consent from a guardian.

Case reports often include a statement that signed consent was obtained from the patient or if it is impossible to receive consent that all possible attempts were made.

## Examples (journal informed consent guidelines)

> "Patient consent
>
> Publication of any personal information about an identifiable living patient requires the explicit consent of the patient or guardian. This is a requirement under the UK's Data Protection legislation. We expect authors to use the BMJ consent form which is available in several languages.
>
> You must have signed informed consent from patients (or relatives/guardians) before submitting to BMJ Case Reports. Please anonymize the patient's details as much as possible, for example, specific ages, ethnicity, occupations. For living patients, this is a legal requirement and we will not send your document for review without explicit consent from the patient or guardian.
>
> If the patient is dead, the Data Protection Act does not apply, but the authors must seek permission from a relative (ideally the next of kin).
>
> If you do not have signed consent from a deceased patient, guardian, or family, the head of your medical team/hospital or legal team must take responsibility that exhaustive attempts have been made to contact the family and that the paper has been sufficiently anonymized not to cause harm to the patient or their family. You will need to upload a signed document to this effect."
