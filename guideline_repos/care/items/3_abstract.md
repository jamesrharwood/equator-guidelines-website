## What to write

3a – Introduction: What does this case add?

3b – Case presentation:

* The main symptoms of the patient(s).
* The main clinical findings.
* The main diagnoses and interventions.
* The main outcomes.

3c – Conclusion: What are the main "take-away" lessons from this case?

## Explanation

The abstract is often the first section a reader encounters, providing a summary to help them determine their interest in the case report [@ref18; @ref19]. Abstracts provide a balanced and succinct summary of the full report and customarily range from 100 to 250 words, depending on the journal [@ref20]. The abstract also aids indexing and identification of case reports in electronic databases [@ref21].

The case report' abstract first briefly summarizes the background information in a sentence or two to orient the reader to the relationship between existing knowledge and the case. Second, the case report identifies the focus of the case report and summarizes this episode of care. Finally, the abstract concludes with one to two sentences that highlight the > "take-away" lesson from the case report, with an emphasis on a single priority message [@ref22; @ref23].

When written last, the abstract can often more accurately reflect the completed case report. Medical journals vary in their requirements for an unstructured versus a structured abstract. A structured abstract for a case report typically includes three sections: the introduction, case presentation, and conclusion [@ref18; @ref20].

## Examples

### Unstructured

> "A retrovirus belonging to the family of recently discovered human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV), but clearly distinct from each previous isolate, has been isolated from a Caucasian patient with signs and symptoms that often precede the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies, it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS."

### Structured

> "Introduction: We report an adolescent boy with minimal pre-existing risk for thromboses who suffered central retinal vein occlusion associated with isotretinoin use for acne. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of this association.
>
> Case presentation: An otherwise healthy 17-year-old white man who was treated with systemic isotretinoin for recalcitrant acne was referred with central retinal vein occlusion in one eye. Although a detailed investigation was negative, DNA testing revealed that the patient was a heterozygous carrier of the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene. Despite the fact that this particular mutation is thought to represent only a minor risk factor for thromboses, it is probable that isotretinoin treatment greatly increased the risk of a vaso-occlusive incident in this patient.
>
> Conclusion: Isotretinoin use may be associated with sight- and life-threatening thrombotic adverse effects even in young patients with otherwise minimal thrombophilic risk. Physicians should be aware of such potential dangers."
