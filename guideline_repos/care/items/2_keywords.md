## What to write

The key elements of this case in 2–5 words.

## Explanation

Medical journals sometimes require authors to choose keywords for case reports. Keywords that identify the focus of the case report can be selected using MeSH terminology (available at [www.pubmed.com](www.pubmed.com)) or Google Scholar. Include the term "case report" as one of the keywords to identify the type of publication and aid database searches.

## Example

> "Keywords: abdominal aortic aneurysm; aorta; case report; hyperattenuating crescent; imaging; mural thrombus; review; rupture"

From _Impending aortic aneurysm rupture—a case report and review of the warning signs_ [@ref17].
