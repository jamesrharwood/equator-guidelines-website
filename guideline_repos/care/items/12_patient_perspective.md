## What to write

When appropriate patients should share their perspectives on the treatments they received.

## Explanation

Whenever possible and relevant, provide patients with an opportunity to briefly share their perspectives on the episode of care. They may describe their motivations for seeking care, changes they associate with an intervention, or the impact of care on their quality of life. The report of a truly novel treatment may rely heavily on a patient's perspective. Patients can be co-authors, which may require additional consent, owing to the loss of anonymity. A proxy, such as the parent of a minor, can provide a perspective when appropriate. In some cases, the line is blurred, and the author—usually a clinician—is also the patient [@ref59].

## Example

> "I am a very active person and enjoy playing tennis and gardening. My symptoms before coming to George Washington (GW) Center for Integrative Medicine prevented me from participating in the leisure activities that I enjoy. The quality of my sleep and my overall quality of life were not good. After coming to the GW Center for Integrative Medicine, all of my symptoms improved and I experienced a drastic improvement in my quality of life.
>
> I did not follow an ‘elimination diet’ per se, but rather was instructed to follow a diet with foods to avoid based on my testing. I experienced a relapse of my sinus symptoms when I deviated too much from the diet, but am now able to control the symptoms by adjusting my diet accordingly."
