## What to write

5a – Demographic information of the patient (age, gender, ethnicity, occupation).

5b – Main symptoms of the patient (chief complaint).

5c – Medical, family, and psychosocial history—including lifestyle and genetic information whenever possible, details about relevant comorbidities, and past interventions, and their outcomes.

## Explanation

We suggest including relevant demographic information about the patient while maintaining anonymity. Characteristics to identify the patient should ideally include age, sex and gender, race, and ethnicity—these characteristics may become important if many cases are subsequently reported. See the list below, from the US Department of Health and Human Services, of some personal identifiers that should not be used in a case report because they might reveal the patient's identity.

When appropriate, include the patient's own words about their chief complaint or symptoms that led to their initial visit. Specify how long symptoms have been present and if relevant, the frequency, intensity, location, and aggravating or alleviating factors. Distinguish comorbidities, when they began, whether they are recurring, past and current interventions and their outcomes. When discussing a history of allergies, include allergens, dates of reactions, and the type of allergic manifestation [@ref20].

Other historical factors may be relevant, such as:

* Perinatal history, such as type of birth, length of pregnancy, if breast-fed, and for how long
* Psychosocial history (e.g., occupation, social support, education level)
* Type of health insurance
* Environmental exposures (living and working environment, potential toxic exposures)
* Lifestyle (sleep, stress management, exercise, recreational drug use, smoking, alcohol consumption, and nutrition/diet)
* Family medical history (e.g., if family members have similar conditions as the patient)
* Genetic information (relevant to the case)

### Patient identifiers to be excluded

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the following personal identifiers should not be used in a case report because they might reveal the patient's identity:

* Names
* Geographic regions
* Elements of dates including birth date, date of death, and admission/discharge date
* Listing ages older than 89 years require additional consent unless providing a single category of age >90 years
* Telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses
* Personal identifying numbers (e.g., social security numbers, medical record numbers)
* Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
* Biometric identifiers, photographs and images (without specific additional permission) [@ref31],
* Other unique, identifying characteristics or codes

## Examples

5a, 5b, and 5c—Patient information.

> "Case Report: The proband is a male born in 1942. At the age of 19 years, he had his first episode of deep venous thrombosis in one leg. After this, he was healthy and free of thrombosis for almost 20 years. Between 1980 and 1987, he had multiple episodes of deep venous thrombosis, at least once a year. The thrombotic events were treated with vitamin K antagonists for periods of up to 3 months. The presence of a thrombus was verified with phlebography on at least two occasions. The proband has developed a postthrombotic syndrome in his legs but has no other disorders. Several members of the proband's family have similar histories of multiple episodes of deep venous thrombosis (Fig. 1). His older brother by 10 years (III-2) has had deep venous thrombosis (in the legs) on several occasions, most of them occurring between the ages of 45 and 50 years. Also, his uncle (11-7) and aunt (II-5) have both had multiple episodes of thrombosis.
>
> A younger relative (IV-2) had clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis during her third pregnancy, but phlebography failed technically. The proband's father, who had no history of thrombosis, is deceased. Nineteen of the family members (all living members of generations II–IV) were available for testing. Two additional, unrelated cases with thrombophilia and inherited poor response to APC were identified; their medical histories are briefly described in the legend to Fig. 6."
