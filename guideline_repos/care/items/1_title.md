## What to write

The area of focus and “case report” should appear in the title.

## Explanation

The title should be succinct and help readers clearly identify the focus of the case report (e.g., medical condition, intervention, outcome, population). It is useful if the article is identified as a case report [@ref15]. This facilitates indexing in databases and may improve search results. “Case reports” are in MeSH (Medical Subject Headings—available at [www.pubmed.com](www.pubmed.com)), a National Library of Medicine controlled vocabulary thesaurus used for indexing articles included in MEDLINE.

## Example

> “Successful heart transplantation after 13 hours of donor heart ischemia with the use of HTK solution: a case report” [@ref16].
