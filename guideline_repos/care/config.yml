      A case report is a narrative that describes, for medical, scientific or
      educational purposes, a medical problem experienced by one or more patients.
      Case reports written without guidance from reporting standards are
      insufficiently rigorous to guide clinical practice or to inform clinical
      study design. Develop, disseminate and implement systematic reporting
      guidelines for case reports. We used a three-phase consensus process
      consisting of (1) premeeting literature review and interviews to generate
      items for the reporting guidelines, (2) a face-to-face consensus meeting to
      draft the reporting guidelines and (3) postmeeting feedback, review and
      pilot testing, followed by finalisation of the case report guidelines. This
      consensus process involved 27 participants and resulted in a 13-item
      checklistâ€”a reporting guideline for case reports. The primary items of the
      checklist are title, key words, abstract, introduction, patient information,
      clinical findings, timeline, diagnostic assessment, therapeutic
      interventions, follow-up and outcomes, discussion, patient perspective and
      informed consent. We believe the implementation of the CARE (CAse REport)
      guidelines by medical journals will improve the completeness and
      transparency of published case reports and that the systematic aggregation
      of information from case reports will inform clinical study design, provide
      early signals of effectiveness and harms, and improve healthcare delivery.
