**You can use STROBE-cohort if you're writing up research investigating potential risk factors for a disease by comparing groups with and without the disease**

You can also use this reporting guideline for:

* writing a proposal or protocol for a case-control study (use the items within the Introduction and Method sections).
* reviewing the _reporting_ of a case-control study article, but not for appraising its quality
