The scientific background of the study provides important context for readers. It sets the stage for the study and describes its focus. It gives an overview of what is known on a topic and what gaps in current knowledge are addressed by the study. Background material should note recent pertinent studies and any systematic reviews of pertinent studies.

## Examples

> Concerns about the rising prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents have focused on the well documented associations between childhood obesity and increased cardiovascular risk1 and mortality in adulthood.2 Childhood obesity has considerable social and psychological consequences within childhood and adolescence,3 yet little is known about social, socioeconomic, and psychological consequences in adult life.
A recent systematic review found no longitudinal studies on the outcomes of childhood obesity other than physical health outcomes3 and only two longitudinal studies of the socioeconomic effects of obesity in adolescence. Gortmaker et al found that US women who had been obese in late adolescence in 1981 were less likely to be married and had lower incomes seven years later than women who had not been overweight, while men who had been overweight were less likely to be married.4 Sargent et al found that UK women, but not men, who had been obese at 16 years in 1974 earned 7.4% less than their non-obese peers at age 23.5
The study of adult outcomes of childhood obesity is difficult because obesity often continues into adult life and therefore poorer socioeconomic and educational outcomes may actually reflect confounding by adult obesity. Yet identifying outcomes related to obesity confined childhood is important in determining whether people who are obese in childhood and who later lose weight remain at risk for adult adversity and inequalities.
We used longitudinal data from the 1970 British birth cohort to examine the adult socioeconomic, educational, social, and psychological outcomes of childhood obesity. We hypothesised that obesity limited to childhood has fewer adverse adult outcomes than obesity that persists into adult life
