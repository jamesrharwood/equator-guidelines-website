There are variations of TRIPOD:

* [TRIPOD-SRMA](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-srma/) for reporting systematic reviews of prediction model studies
* [TRIPOD-cluster](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-cluster/) for reporting studies of prediction models developed or validated using clustered data
* [TRIPOD-LLM](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/the-tripod-llm-reporting-guideline-for-studies-using-large-language-models/) for reporting studies developing, tuning, prompt engineering or evaluating a large language prediction model
