Some readers use an abstract as a screening tool to decide whether to read the full article. However, as not all trials are freely available and some health professionals do not have access to the full trial reports, healthcare decisions are sometimes made on the basis of abstracts of randomised trials.66\n\nA journal abstract should contain sufficient information about a trial to serve as an accurate record of its conduct and findings, providing optimal information about the trial within the space constraints and format of a journal. A properly constructed and written abstract helps individuals to assess quickly the relevance of the findings and aids the retrieval of relevant reports from electronic databases.67 The abstract should accurately reflect what is included in the full journal article and should not include information that does not appear in the body of the paper. Studies comparing the accuracy of information reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with, or missing from, the body of the full article.68 69 70 71 Conversely, omitting important harms from the abstract could seriously mislead someone\u2019s interpretation of the trial findings.42 72\n\nA recent extension to the CONSORT statement provides a list of essential items that authors should include when reporting the main results of a randomised trial in a journal (or conference) abstract (see table 2\u200b2).45 We strongly recommend the use of structured abstracts for reporting randomised trials. They provide readers with information about the trial under a series of headings pertaining to the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation.73 Some studies have found that structured abstracts are of higher quality than the more traditional descriptive abstracts74 75 and that they allow readers to find information more easily.76 We recognise that many journals have developed their own structure and word limit for reporting abstracts.

Here we seek information on the type of trial, such as parallel group or factorial, and the conceptual framework, such as superiority or non-inferiority, and other related issues not addressed elsewhere in the checklist.\n\nThe CONSORT statement focuses mainly on trials with participants individually randomised to one of two \u201cparallel\u201d groups. In fact, little more than half of published trials have such a design.16 The main alternative designs are multi-arm parallel, crossover, cluster,40 and factorial designs. Also, most trials are set to identify the superiority of a new intervention, if it exists, but others are designed to assess non-inferiority or equivalence.39 It is important that researchers clearly describe these aspects of their trial, including the unit of randomisation (such as patient, GP practice, lesion). It is desirable also to include these details in the abstract (see item 1b).\n\nIf a less common design is employed, authors are encouraged to explain their choice, especially as such designs may imply the need for a larger sample size or more complex analysis and interpretation.\n\nAlthough most trials use equal randomisation (such as 1:1 for two groups), it is helpful to provide the allocation ratio explicitly. For drug trials, specifying the phase of the trial (I-IV) may also be relevant", "Example 1": "This was a multicenter, stratified (6 to 11 years and 12 to 17 years of age, with imbalanced randomisation [2:1]), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the United States (41 sites", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 6, "EQ_number": 4.01, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Study design", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "3b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Trial design", "RG Checklist text": "Important changes to methods after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons", "text_long": "A few trials may start without any fixed plan (that is, are entirely exploratory), but the most will have a protocol that specifies in great detail how the trial will be conducted. There may be deviations from the original protocol, as it is impossible to predict every possible change in circumstances during the course of a trial. Some trials will therefore have important changes to the methods after trial commencement.\n\nChanges could be due to external information becoming available from other studies, or internal financial difficulties, or could be due to a disappointing recruitment rate. Such protocol changes should be made without breaking the blinding on the accumulating data on participants\u2019 outcomes. In some trials, an independent data monitoring committee will have as part of its remit the possibility of recommending protocol changes based on seeing unblinded data. Such changes might affect the study methods (such as changes to treatment regimens, eligibility criteria, randomisation ratio, or duration of follow-up) or trial conduct (such as dropping a centre with poor data quality).87\n\nSome trials are set up with a formal \u201cadaptive\u201d design. There is no universally accepted definition of these designs, but a working definition might be \u201ca multistage study design that uses accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the study without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial.\u201d88 The modifications are usually to the sample sizes and the number of treatment arms and can lead to decisions being made more quickly and with more efficient use of resources. There are, however, important ethical, statistical, and practical issues in considering such a design.89 90\n\nWhether the modifications are explicitly part of the trial design or in response to changing circumstances, it is essential that they are fully reported to help the reader interpret the results. Changes from protocols are not currently well reported. A review of comparisons with protocols showed that about half of journal articles describing RCTs had an unexplained discrepancy in the primary outcomes.57 Frequent unexplained discrepancies have also been observed for details of randomisation, blinding,91 and statistical analyses", "Example 1": "Patients were randomly assigned to one of six parallel groups, initially in 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, to receive either one of five otamixaban \u2026 regimens \u2026 or an active control of unfractionated heparin \u2026 an independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed unblinded data for patient safety; no interim analyses for efficacy or futility were done. During the trial, this committee recommended that the group receiving the lowest dose of otamixaban (0\u00b7035 mg/kg/h) be discontinued because of clinical evidence of inadequate anticoagulation.

Because they are applied before randomisation, eligibility criteria do not affect the internal validity of a trial, but they are central to its external validity.\n\nTypical and widely accepted selection criteria relate to the nature and stage of the disease being studied, the exclusion of persons thought to be particularly vulnerable to harm from the study intervention, and to issues required to ensure that the study satisfies legal and ethical norms. Informed consent by study participants, for example, is typically required in intervention studies. The common distinction between inclusion and exclusion criteria is unnecessary; the same criterion can be phrased to include or exclude participants.95\n\nDespite their importance, eligibility criteria are often not reported adequately. For example, eight published trials leading to clinical alerts by the National Institutes of Health specified an average of 31 eligibility criteria in their protocols, but only 63% of the criteria were mentioned in the journal articles, and only 19% were mentioned in the clinical alerts.96 Similar deficiencies were found for HIV clinical trials.97 Among 364 reports of RCTs in surgery, 25% did not specify any eligibility criteria", "Example 1": "Eligible participants were all adults aged 18 or over with HIV who met the eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy according to the Malawian national HIV treatment guidelines (WHO clinical stage III or IV or any WHO stage with a CD4 count <250/mm3) and who were starting treatment with a BMI <18.5.

Healthcare institutions vary greatly in their organisation, experience, and resources and the baseline risk for the condition under investigation. Other aspects of the setting (including the social, economic, and cultural environment and the climate) may also affect a study\u2019s external validity.\n\nAuthors should report the number and type of settings and describe the care providers involved. They should report the locations in which the study was carried out, including the country, city if applicable, and immediate environment (for example, community, office practice, hospital clinic, or inpatient unit).

Most trials have several outcomes, some of which are of more interest than others. The primary outcome measure is the pre-specified outcome considered to be of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders (such a patients, policy makers, clinicians, funders) and is usually the one used in the sample size calculation (see item 7). Some trials may have more than one primary outcome. Having several primary outcomes, however, incurs the problems of interpretation associated with multiplicity of analyses (see items 18 and 20) and is not recommended. Primary outcomes should be explicitly indicated as such in the report of an RCT. Other outcomes of interest are secondary outcomes (additional outcomes). There may be several secondary outcomes, which often include unanticipated or unintended effects of the intervention (see item 19), although harms should always be viewed as important whether they are labelled primary or secondary.\n\nAll outcome measures, whether primary or secondary, should be identified and completely defined. The principle here is that the information provided should be sufficient to allow others to use the same outcomes.102 When outcomes are assessed at several time points after randomisation, authors should also indicate the pre-specified time point of primary interest. For many non-pharmacological interventions it is helpful to specify who assessed outcomes (for example, if special skills are required to do so) and how many assessors there were.43\n\nWhere available and appropriate, the use of previously developed and validated scales or consensus guidelines should be reported,104 105 both to enhance quality of measurement and to assist in comparison with similar studies.106 For example, assessment of quality of life is likely to be improved by using a validated instrument.107 Authors should indicate the provenance and properties of scales.\n\nMore than 70 outcomes were used in 196 RCTs of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis,108 and 640 different instruments had been used in 2000 trials in schizophrenia, of which 369 had been used only once.33 Investigation of 149 of those 2000 trials showed that unpublished scales were a source of bias. In non-pharmacological trials, a third of the claims of treatment superiority based on unpublished scales would not have been made if a published scale had been used.109 Similar data have been reported elsewhere.110 111 Only 45% of a cohort of 519 RCTs published in 2000 specified the primary outcome16; this compares with 53% for a similar cohort of 614 RCTs published in 2006", "Example 1": "The primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in psoriasis was the proportion of patients achieving a 75% improvement in psoriasis activity from baseline to 12 weeks as measured by the PASI [psoriasis area and severity index] Additional analyses were done on the percentage change in PASI scores and improvement in target psoriasis lesions.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 11, "EQ_number": 4.07, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Outcomes", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "6b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Outcomes", "RG Checklist text": "Any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons", "text_long": "There are many reasons for departures from the initial study protocol (see item 24). Authors should report all major changes to the protocol, including unplanned changes to eligibility criteria, interventions, examinations, data collection, methods of analysis, and outcomes. Such information is not always reported.\n\nAs indicated earlier (see item 6a), most trials record multiple outcomes, with the risk that results will be reported for only a selected subset (see item 17). Pre-specification and reporting of primary and secondary outcomes (see item 6a) should remove such a risk. In some trials, however, circumstances require a change in the way an outcome is assessed or even, as in the example above, a switch to a different outcome. For example, there may be external evidence from other trials or systematic reviews suggesting the end point might not be appropriate, or recruitment or the overall event rate in the trial may be lower than expected.112 Changing an end point based on unblinded data is much more problematic, although it may be specified in the context of an adaptive trial design.88 Authors should identify and explain any such changes. Likewise, any changes after the trial began of the designation of outcomes as primary or secondary should be reported and explained.\n\nA comparison of protocols and publications of 102 randomised trials found that 62% of trials reports had at least one primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted compared with the protocol.55 Primary outcomes also differed between protocols and publications for 40% of a cohort of 48 trials funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.113 Not one of the subsequent 150 trial reports mentioned, let alone explained, changes from the protocol. Similar results from other studies have been reported recently in a systematic review of empirical studies examining outcome reporting bias", "Example 1": "The original primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, but, during a masked analysis, the data and safety monitoring board noted that overall mortality was lower than had been predicted and that the study could not be completed with the sample size and power originally planned. The steering committee therefore decided to adopt co-primary endpoints of all-cause mortality (the original primary endpoint), together with all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admissions (the first prespecified secondary endpoint).", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 11, "EQ_number": 4.045, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Sample size calculation", "display_number": "7a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Sample size", "RG Checklist text": "How sample size was determined. ", "text_long": "For scientific and ethical reasons, the sample size for a trial needs to be planned carefully, with a balance between medical and statistical considerations. Ideally, a study should be large enough to have a high probability (power) of detecting as statistically significant a clinically important difference of a given size if such a difference exists. The size of effect deemed important is inversely related to the sample size necessary to detect it; that is, large samples are necessary to detect small differences. Elements of the sample size calculation are (1) the estimated outcomes in each group (which implies the clinically important target difference between the intervention groups); (2) the \u03b1 (type I) error level; (3) the statistical power (or the \u03b2 (type II) error level); and (4), for continuous outcomes, the standard deviation of the measurements.116 The interplay of these elements and their reporting will differ for cluster trials40 and non-inferiority and equivalence trials.39\n\nAuthors should indicate how the sample size was determined. If a formal power calculation was used, the authors should identify the primary outcome on which the calculation was based (see item 6a), all the quantities used in the calculation, and the resulting target sample size per study group. It is preferable to quote the expected result in the control group and the difference between the groups one would not like to overlook. Alternatively, authors could present the percentage with the event or mean for each group used in their calculations. Details should be given of any allowance made for attrition or non-compliance during the study.\n\nSome methodologists have written that so called underpowered trials may be acceptable because they could ultimately be combined in a systematic review and meta-analysis,117 118 119 and because some information is better than no information. Of note, important caveats apply\u2014such as the trial should be unbiased, reported properly, and published irrespective of the results, thereby becoming available for meta-analysis.118 On the other hand, many medical researchers worry that underpowered trials with indeterminate results will remain unpublished and insist that all trials should individually have \u201csufficient power.\u201d This debate will continue, and members of the CONSORT Group have varying views. Critically however, the debate and those views are immaterial to reporting a trial. Whatever the power of a trial, authors need to properly report their intended size with all their methods and assumptions.118 That transparently reveals the power of the trial to readers and gives them a measure by which to assess whether the trial attained its planned size.\n\nIn some trials, interim analyses are used to help decide whether to stop early or to continue recruiting sometimes beyond the planned trial end (see item 7b). If the actual sample size differed from the originally intended sample size for some other reason (for example, because of poor recruitment or revision of the target sample size), the explanation should be given.\n\nReports of studies with small samples frequently include the erroneous conclusion that the intervention groups do not differ, when in fact too few patients were studied to make such a claim.120 Reviews of published trials have consistently found that a high proportion of trials have low power to detect clinically meaningful treatment effects.121 122 123 In reality, small but clinically meaningful true differences are much more likely than large differences to exist, but large trials are required to detect them.124\n\nIn general, the reported sample sizes in trials seem small. The median sample size was 54 patients in 196 trials in arthritis,108 46 patients in 73 trials in dermatology,8 and 65 patients in 2000 trials in schizophrenia.33 These small sample sizes are consistent with those of a study of 519 trials indexed in PubMed in December 200016 and a similar cohort of trials (n=616) indexed in PubMed in 2006,17 where the median number of patients recruited for parallel group trials was 80 across both years. Moreover, many reviews have found that few authors report how they determined the sample size.8 14 32 33 123\n\nThere is little merit in a post hoc calculation of statistical power using the results of a trial; the power is then appropriately indicated by confidence intervals (see item 17).", "Example 1": "To detect a reduction in PHS (postoperative hospital stay) of 3 days (SD 5 days), which is in agreement with the study of Lobo et al17 with a two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, a sample size of 50 patients per group was necessary, given an anticipated dropout rate of 10%.

This concern can be addressed by examining results as the data accumulate, preferably by an independent data monitoring committee. However, performing multiple statistical examinations of accumulating data without appropriate correction can lead to erroneous results and interpretations.128 If the accumulating data from a trial are examined at five interim analyses that use a P value of 0.05, the overall false positive rate is nearer to 19% than to the nominal 5%.\n\nSeveral group sequential statistical methods are available to adjust for multiple analyses,129 130 131 and their use should be pre-specified in the trial protocol. With these methods, data are compared at each interim analysis, and a P value less than the critical value specified by the group sequential method indicates statistical significance. Some trialists use group sequential methods as an aid to decision making,132 whereas others treat them as a formal stopping rule (with the intention that the trial will cease if the observed P value is smaller than the critical value).\n\nAuthors should report whether they or a data monitoring committee took multiple \u201clooks\u201d at the data and, if so, how many there were, what triggered them, the statistical methods used (including any formal stopping rule), and whether they were planned before the start of the trial, before the data monitoring committee saw any interim data by allocation, or some time thereafter.

It is important that information on the process of randomisation is included in the body of the main article and not as a separate supplementary file; where it can be missed by the reader.\n\nThe term \u201crandom\u201d has a precise technical meaning. With random allocation, each participant has a known probability of receiving each intervention before one is assigned, but the assigned intervention is determined by a chance process and cannot be predicted. However, \u201crandom\u201d is often used inappropriately in the literature to describe trials in which non-random, deterministic allocation methods were used, such as alternation, hospital numbers, or date of birth. When investigators use such non-random methods, they should describe them precisely and should not use the term \u201crandom\u201d or any variation of it. Even the term \u201cquasi-random\u201d is unacceptable for describing such trials. Trials based on non-random methods generally yield biased results.2 3 4 136 Bias presumably arises from the inability to conceal these allocation systems adequately (see item 9).\n\nMany methods of sequence generation are adequate. However, readers cannot judge adequacy from such terms as \u201crandom allocation,\u201d \u201crandomisation,\u201d or \u201crandom\u201d without further elaboration. Authors should specify the method of sequence generation, such as a random-number table or a computerised random number generator. The sequence may be generated by the process of minimisation, a non-random but generally acceptable method (see box 2). In some trials, participants are intentionally allocated in unequal numbers to each intervention: for example, to gain more experience with a new procedure or to limit costs of the trial. In such cases, authors should report the randomisation ratio (for example, 2:1 or two treatment participants per each control participant) (see item 3a).\n\nIn a representative sample of PubMed indexed trials in 2000, only 21% reported an adequate approach to random sequence generation16; this increased to 34% for a similar cohort of PubMed indexed trials in 2006.17 In more than 90% of these cases, researchers used a random number generator on a computer or a random number table.", "Example 1": "Independent pharmacists dispensed either active or placebo inhalers according to a computer generated randomisation list.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 14, "EQ_number": 4.041, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minmising bias", "EQ heading 3": "randomization: sequence generation", "display_number": "8b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Randomization - Sequence generation", "RG Checklist text": "Type of randomization; details of any restriction (such as blocking and block size)\n", "text_long": "In trials of several hundred participants or more simple randomisation can usually be trusted to generate similar numbers in the two trial groups139 and to generate groups that are roughly comparable in terms of known and unknown prognostic variables.140 For smaller trials (see item 7a)\u2014and even for trials that are not intended to be small, as they may stop before reaching their target size\u2014some restricted randomisation (procedures to help achieve balance between groups in size or characteristics) may be useful (see box 2).\n\nIt is important to indicate whether no restriction was used, by stating such or by stating that \u201csimple randomisation\u201d was done. Otherwise, the methods used to restrict the randomisation, along with the method used for random selection, should be specified. For block randomisation, authors should provide details on how the blocks were generated (for example, by using a permuted block design with a computer random number generator), the block size or sizes, and whether the block size was fixed or randomly varied. If the trialists became aware of the block size(s), that information should also be reported as such knowledge could lead to code breaking. Authors should specify whether stratification was used, and if so, which factors were involved (such as recruitment site, sex, disease stage), the categorisation cut-off values within strata, and the method used for restriction. Although stratification is a useful technique, especially for smaller trials, it is complicated to implement and may be impossible if many stratifying factors are used. If minimisation (see box 2) was used, it should be explicitly identified, as should the variables incorporated into the scheme. If used, a random element should be indicated.\n\nOnly 9% of 206 reports of trials in specialty journals23 and 39% of 80 trials in general medical journals reported use of stratification.32 In each case, only about half of the reports mentioned the use of restricted randomisation. However, these studies and that of Adetugbo and Williams8 found that the sizes of the treatment groups in many trials were the same or quite similar, yet blocking or stratification had not been mentioned. One possible explanation for the close balance in numbers is underreporting of the use of restricted randomisation.", "Example 1": "Randomization sequence was created using Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) statistical software and was stratified by center with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 15, "EQ_number": 4.042, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minmising bias", "EQ heading 3": "randomization: allocation concealment", "display_number": 9, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Randomization - Allocation concealment mechanism", "RG Checklist text": "Mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence (such as sequentially numbered containers), describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were assigned", "text_long": "Item 8a discussed generation of an unpredictable sequence of assignments. Of considerable importance is how this sequence is applied when participants are enrolled into the trial (see box 1). A generated allocation schedule should be implemented by using allocation concealment,23 a critical mechanism that prevents foreknowledge of treatment assignment and thus shields those who enroll participants from being influenced by this knowledge. The decision to accept or reject a participant should be made, and informed consent should be obtained from the participant, in ignorance of the next assignment in the sequence.148\n\nThe allocation concealment should not be confused with blinding (see item 11). Allocation concealment seeks to prevent selection bias, protects the assignment sequence until allocation, and can always be successfully implemented.2 In contrast, blinding seeks to prevent performance and ascertainment bias, protects the sequence after allocation, and cannot always be implemented.23 Without adequate allocation concealment, however, even random, unpredictable assignment sequences can be subverted.2 149\n\nCentralised or \u201cthird-party\u201d assignment is especially desirable. Many good allocation concealment mechanisms incorporate external involvement. Use of a pharmacy or central telephone randomisation system are two common techniques. Automated assignment systems are likely to become more common.150 When external involvement is not feasible, an excellent method of allocation concealment is the use of numbered containers. The interventions (often drugs) are sealed in sequentially numbered identical containers according to the allocation sequence.151 Enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes can be a good allocation concealment mechanism if it is developed and monitored diligently. This method can be corrupted, however, particularly if it is poorly executed. Investigators should ensure that the envelopes are opaque when held to the light, and opened sequentially and only after the participant\u2019s name and other details are written on the appropriate envelope.143\n\nA number of methodological studies provide empirical evidence to support these precautions.152 153 Trials in which the allocation sequence had been inadequately or unclearly concealed yielded larger estimates of treatment effects than did trials in which authors reported adequate allocation concealment. These findings provide strong empirical evidence that inadequate allocation concealment contributes to bias in estimating treatment effects.\n\nDespite the importance of the mechanism of allocation concealment, published reports often omit such details. The mechanism used to allocate interventions was omitted in reports of 89% of trials in rheumatoid arthritis,108 48% of trials in obstetrics and gynaecology journals,23 and 44% of trials in general medical journals.32 In a more broadly representative sample of all randomised trials indexed on PubMed, only 18% reported any allocation concealment mechanism, but some of those reported mechanisms were inadequate.", "Example 1": "The doxycycline and placebo were in capsule form and identical in appearance. They were prepacked in bottles and consecutively numbered for each woman according to the randomisation schedule. Each woman was assigned an order number and received the capsules in the corresponding prepacked bottle.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 16, "EQ_number": 4.043, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "randomization: implementation", "display_number": 10, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Randomization - Implementation", "RG Checklist text": "Who generated the allocation sequence, who enrolled participants, and who assigned participants to interventions", "text_long": "As noted in item 9, concealment of the allocated intervention at the time of enrolment is especially important. Thus, in addition to knowing the methods used, it is also important to understand how the random sequence was implemented\u2014specifically, who generated the allocation sequence, who enrolled participants, and who assigned participants to trial groups.\n\nThe process of randomising participants into a trial has three different steps: sequence generation, allocation concealment, and implementation (see box 3). Although the same people may carry out more than one process under each heading, investigators should strive for complete separation of the people involved with generation and allocation concealment from the people involved in the implementation of assignments. Thus, if someone is involved in the sequence generation or allocation concealment steps, ideally they should not be involved in the implementation step.\n\nEven with flawless sequence generation and allocation concealment, failure to separate creation and concealment of the allocation sequence from assignment to study group may introduce bias. For example, the person who generated an allocation sequence could retain a copy and consult it when interviewing potential participants for a trial. Thus, that person could bias the enrolment or assignment process, regardless of the unpredictability of the assignment sequence. Investigators must then ensure that the assignment schedule is unpredictable and locked away (such as in a safe deposit box in a building rather inaccessible to the enrolment location) from even the person who generated it. The report of the trial should specify where the investigators stored the allocation list", "Example 1": "Determination of whether a patient would be treated by streptomycin and bed-rest (S case) or by bed-rest alone (C case) was made by reference to a statistical series based on random sampling numbers drawn up for each sex at each centre by Professor Bradford Hill; the details of the series were unknown to any of the investigators or to the co-ordinator \u2026 After acceptance of a patient by the panel, and before admission to the streptomycin centre, the appropriate numbered envelope was opened at the central office; the card inside told if the patient was to be an S or a C case, and this information was then given to the medical officer of the centre.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 17, "EQ_number": 4.044, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Masking", "display_number": "11a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Blinding", "RG Checklist text": "If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions (for example, participants, care providers, those assessing outcomes) and how. ", "text_long": "The term \u201cblinding\u201d or \u201cmasking\u201d refers to withholding information about the assigned interventions from people involved in the trial who may potentially be influenced by this knowledge. Blinding is an important safeguard against bias, particularly when assessing subjective outcomes.153\n\nBenjamin Franklin has been credited as being the first to use blinding in a scientific experiment.158 He blindfolded participants so they would not know when he was applying mesmerism (a popular \u201chealing fluid\u201d of the 18th century) and in so doing showed that mesmerism was a sham. Based on this experiment, the scientific community recognised the power of blinding to reduce bias, and it has remained a commonly used strategy in scientific experiments.\n\nBox 4, on blinding terminology, defines the groups of individuals (that is, participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts) who can potentially introduce bias into a trial through knowledge of the treatment assignments. Participants may respond differently if they are aware of their treatment assignment (such as responding more favourably when they receive the new treatment).153 Lack of blinding may also influence compliance with the intervention, use of co-interventions, and risk of dropping out of the trial.\n\nUnblinded healthcare providers may introduce similar biases, and unblinded data collectors may differentially assess outcomes (such as frequency or timing), repeat measurements of abnormal findings, or provide encouragement during performance testing. Unblinded outcome adjudicators may differentially assess subjective outcomes, and unblinded data analysts may introduce bias through the choice of analytical strategies, such as the selection of favourable time points or outcomes, and by decisions to remove patients from the analyses. These biases have been well documented.71 153 159 160 161 162\n\nBlinding, unlike allocation concealment (see item 10), may not always be appropriate or possible. An example is a trial comparing levels of pain associated with sampling blood from the ear or thumb.163 Blinding is particularly important when outcome measures involve some subjectivity, such as assessment of pain. Blinding of data collectors and outcome adjudicators is unlikely to matter for objective outcomes, such as death from any cause. Even then, however, lack of participant or healthcare provider blinding can lead to other problems, such as differential attrition.164 In certain trials, especially surgical trials, blinding of participants and surgeons is often difficult or impossible, but blinding of data collectors and outcome adjudicators is often achievable. For example, lesions can be photographed before and after treatment and assessed by an external observer.165 Regardless of whether blinding is possible, authors can and should always state who was blinded (that is, participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators).\n\nUnfortunately, authors often do not report whether blinding was used.166 For example, reports of 51% of 506 trials in cystic fibrosis,167 33% of 196 trials in rheumatoid arthritis,108 and 38% of 68 trials in dermatology8 did not state whether blinding was used. Until authors of trials improve their reporting of blinding, readers will have difficulty in judging the validity of the trials that they may wish to use to guide their clinical practice.\n\nThe term masking is sometimes used in preference to blinding to avoid confusion with the medical condition of being without sight. However, \u201cblinding\u201d in its methodological sense seems to be understood worldwide and is acceptable for reporting clinical trials.", "Example 1": "Whereas patients and physicians allocated to the intervention group were aware of the allocated arm, outcome assessors and data analysts were kept blinded to the allocation.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 18, "EQ_number": 4.044, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Masking", "display_number": "11b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Blinding", "RG Checklist text": "If relevant, description of the similarity of interventions", "text_long": "Just as we seek evidence of concealment to assure us that assignment was truly random, we seek evidence of the method of blinding. In trials with blinding of participants or healthcare providers, authors should state the similarity of the characteristics of the interventions (such as appearance, taste, smell, and method of administration).35 173\n\nSome people have advocated testing for blinding by asking participants or healthcare providers at the end of a trial whether they think the participant received the experimental or control intervention.174 Because participants and healthcare providers will usually know whether the participant has experienced the primary outcome, this makes it difficult to determine if their responses reflect failure of blinding or accurate assumptions about the efficacy of the intervention.175 Given the uncertainty this type of information provides, we have removed advocating reporting this type of testing for blinding from the CONSORT 2010 Statement. We do, however, advocate that the authors report any known compromises in blinding. For example, authors should report if it was necessary to unblind any participants at any point during the conduct of a trial.", "Example 1": "Jamieson Laboratories Inc provided 500-mg immediate release niacin in a white, oblong, bisect caplet.

The principle to follow is to, \u201cDescribe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results\u201d (www.icmje.org). It is also important to describe details of the statistical analysis such as intention-to-treat analysis (see box 6).\n\nAlmost all methods of analysis yield an estimate of the treatment effect, which is a contrast between the outcomes in the comparison groups. Authors should accompany this by a confidence interval for the estimated effect, which indicates a central range of uncertainty for the true treatment effect. The confidence interval may be interpreted as the range of values for the treatment effect that is compatible with the observed data. It is customary to present a 95% confidence interval, which gives the range expected to include the true value in 95 of 100 similar studies.\n\nStudy findings can also be assessed in terms of their statistical significance. The P value represents the probability that the observed data (or a more extreme result) could have arisen by chance when the interventions did not truly differ. Actual P values (for example, P=0.003) are strongly preferable to imprecise threshold reports such as P<0.05.48 177\n\nStandard methods of analysis assume that the data are \u201cindependent.\u201d For controlled trials, this usually means that there is one observation per participant. Treating multiple observations from one participant as independent data is a serious error; such data are produced when outcomes can be measured on different parts of the body, as in dentistry or rheumatology. Data analysis should be based on counting each participant once178 179 or should be done by using more complex statistical procedures.180 Incorrect analysis of multiple observations per individual was seen in 123 (63%) of 196 trials in rheumatoid arthritis.", "Example 1": "The primary endpoint was change in bodyweight during the 20 weeks of the study in the intention-to-treat population \u2026 Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, prevalence of metabolic syndrome \u2026 We used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for the primary endpoint and for secondary endpoints waist circumference, blood pressure, and patient-reported outcome scores; this was supplemented by a repeated measures analysis.

The strongest analyses are those that look for evidence of a difference in treatment effect in complementary subgroups (for example, older and younger participants), a comparison known as a test of interaction.182 183 A common but misleading approach is to compare P values for separate analyses of the treatment effect in each group. It is incorrect to infer a subgroup effect (interaction) from one significant and one non-significant P value.184 Such inferences have a high false positive rate.\n\nBecause of the high risk for spurious findings, subgroup analyses are often discouraged.14 185 Post hoc subgroup comparisons (analyses done after looking at the data) are especially likely not to be confirmed by further studies. Such analyses do not have great credibility.\n\nIn some studies, imbalances in participant characteristics are adjusted for by using some form of multiple regression analysis. Although the need for adjustment is much less in RCTs than in epidemiological studies, an adjusted analysis may be sensible, especially if one or more variables is thought to be prognostic.186 Ideally, adjusted analyses should be specified in the study protocol (see item 24). For example, adjustment is often recommended for any stratification variables (see item 8b) on the principle that the analysis strategy should follow the design. In RCTs, the decision to adjust should not be determined by whether baseline differences are statistically significant (see item 16).183 187 The rationale for any adjusted analyses and the statistical methods used should be specified.\n\nAuthors should clarify the choice of variables that were adjusted for, indicate how continuous variables were handled, and specify whether the analysis was planned or suggested by the data.188 Reviews of published studies show that reporting of adjusted analyses is inadequate with regard to all of these aspects.188 189 190 191", "Example 1": "Proportions of patients responding were compared between treatment groups with the Mantel-Haenszel \u03c72 test, adjusted for the stratification variable, methotrexate use.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 21, "EQ_number": 5.011, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Data", "EQ heading 3": "Participant flow", "display_number": "13a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "Results", "RG checklist heading 2": "Participant flow diagram (strongly recommended)", "RG Checklist text": "A diagram is strongly recommended.

In more complex studies, it may be difficult for readers to discern whether and why some participants did not receive the treatment as allocated, were lost to follow-up, or were excluded from the analysis.51 This information is crucial for several reasons. Participants who were excluded after allocation are unlikely to be representative of all participants in the study. For example, patients may not be available for follow-up evaluation because they experienced an acute exacerbation of their illness or harms of treatment.22 192\n\nAttrition as a result of loss to follow up, which is often unavoidable, needs to be distinguished from investigator-determined exclusion for such reasons as ineligibility, withdrawal from treatment, and poor adherence to the trial protocol. Erroneous conclusions can be reached if participants are excluded from analysis, and imbalances in such omissions between groups may be especially indicative of bias.192 193 194 Information about whether the investigators included in the analysis all participants who underwent randomisation, in the groups to which they were originally allocated (intention-to-treat analysis (see item 16 and box 6)), is therefore of particular importance. Knowing the number of participants who did not receive the intervention as allocated or did not complete treatment permits the reader to assess to what extent the estimated efficacy of therapy might be underestimated in comparison with ideal circumstances.\n\nIf available, the number of people assessed for eligibility should also be reported. Although this number is relevant to external validity only and is arguably less important than the other counts,195 it is a useful indicator of whether trial participants were likely to be representative of all eligible participants.\n\nA review of RCTs published in five leading general and internal medicine journals in 1998 found that reporting of the flow of participants was often incomplete, particularly with regard to the number of participants receiving the allocated intervention and the number lost to follow-up.51 Even information as basic as the number of participants who underwent randomisation and the number excluded from analyses was not available in up to 20% of articles.51 Reporting was considerably more thorough in articles that included a diagram of the flow of participants through a trial, as recommended by CONSORT. This study informed the design of the revised flow diagram in the revised CONSORT statement.52 53 54 The suggested template is shown in fig 1\u200b1,, and the counts required are described in detail in table 3\u200b3.\n\nSome information, such as the number of individuals assessed for eligibility, may not always be known,14 and, depending on the nature of a trial, some counts may be more relevant than others. It will sometimes be useful or necessary to adapt the structure of the flow diagram to a particular trial. In some situations, other information may usefully be added. For example, the flow diagram of a parallel group trial of minimal surgery compared with medical management for chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux also included a parallel non-randomised preference group (see fig 3).196\n\nThe exact form and content of the flow diagram may be varied according to specific features of a trial.

This information allows readers, especially clinicians, to judge how relevant the results of a trial might be to an individual patient.\n\nRandomised trials aim to compare groups of participants that differ only with respect to the intervention (treatment). Although proper random assignment prevents selection bias, it does not guarantee that the groups are equivalent at baseline. Any differences in baseline characteristics are, however, the result of chance rather than bias.32 The study groups should be compared at baseline for important demographic and clinical characteristics so that readers can assess how similar they were. Baseline data are especially valuable for outcomes that can also be measured at the start of the trial (such as blood pressure).\n\nBaseline information is most efficiently presented in a table (see table 4\u200b4).). For continuous variables, such as weight or blood pressure, the variability of the data should be reported, along with average values. Continuous variables can be summarised for each group by the mean and standard deviation. When continuous data have an asymmetrical distribution, a preferable approach may be to quote the median and a centile range (such as the 25th and 75th centiles).177 Standard errors and confidence intervals are not appropriate for describing variability\u2014they are inferential rather than descriptive statistics. Variables with a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be treated as continuous variables; instead, numbers and proportions should be reported for each category.48 177\n\nUnfortunately significance tests of baseline differences are still common23 32 210; they were reported in half of 50 RCTs trials published in leading general journals in 1997.183 Such significance tests assess the probability that observed baseline differences could have occurred by chance; however, we already know that any differences are caused by chance. Tests of baseline differences are not necessarily wrong, just illogical.211 Such hypothesis testing is superfluous and can mislead investigators and their readers. Rather, comparisons at baseline should be based on consideration of the prognostic strength of the variables measured and the size of any chance imbalances that have occurred", "Example 1": "Example of reporting baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.* (Adapted from table 1 of Yusuf et al209) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844943/table/tbl4/", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 26, "EQ_number": 5.013, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Data", "EQ heading 3": "Numbers analysed", "display_number": 16, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Numbers analysed", "RG Checklist text": "For each group, number of participants (denominator) included in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned groups", "text_long": "The number of participants in each group is an essential element of the analyses. Although the flow diagram (see item 13a) may indicate the numbers of participants analysed, these numbers often vary for different outcome measures. The number of participants per group should be given for all analyses. For binary outcomes, (such as risk ratio and risk difference) the denominators or event rates should also be reported. Expressing results as fractions also aids the reader in assessing whether some of the randomly assigned participants were excluded from the analysis. It follows that results should not be presented solely as summary measures, such as relative risks.\n\nParticipants may sometimes not receive the full intervention, or some ineligible patients may have been randomly allocated in error. One widely recommended way to handle such issues is to analyse all participants according to their original group assignment, regardless of what subsequently occurred (see box 6). This \u201cintention-to-treat\u201d strategy is not always straightforward to implement. It is common for some patients not to complete a study\u2014they may drop out or be withdrawn from active treatment\u2014and thus are not assessed at the end. If the outcome is mortality, such patients may be included in the analysis based on register information, whereas imputation techniques may need to be used if other outcome data are missing. The term \u201cintention-to-treat analysis\u201d is often inappropriately used\u2014for example, when those who did not receive the first dose of a trial drug are excluded from the analyses.18\n\nConversely, analysis can be restricted to only participants who fulfil the protocol in terms of eligibility, interventions, and outcome assessment. This analysis is known as an \u201con-treatment\u201d or \u201cper protocol\u201d analysis. Excluding participants from the analysis can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, in a trial that compared medical with surgical therapy for carotid stenosis, analysis limited to participants who were available for follow-up showed that surgery reduced the risk for transient ischaemic attack, stroke, and death. However, intention-to-treat analysis based on all participants as originally assigned did not show a superior effect of surgery.214\n\nIntention-to-treat analysis is generally favoured because it avoids bias associated with non-random loss of participants.215 216 217 Regardless of whether authors use the term \u201cintention-to-treat,\u201d they should make clear which and how many participants are included in each analysis (see item 13). Non-compliance with assigned therapy may mean that the intention-to-treat analysis underestimates the potential benefit of the treatment, and additional analyses, such as a per protocol analysis, may therefore be considered.218 219 It should be noted, however, that such analyses are often considerably flawed.220\n\nIn a review of 403 RCTs published in 10 leading medical journals in 2002, 249 (62%) reported the use of intention-to-treat analysis for their primary analysis. This proportion was higher for journals adhering to the CONSORT statement (70% v 48%). Among articles that reported the use of intention-to-treat analysis, only 39% actually analysed all participants as randomised, with more than 60% of articles having missing data in their primary analysis.221 Other studies show similar findings.18 222 223 Trials with no reported exclusions are methodologically weaker in other respects than those that report on some excluded participants,173 strongly indicating that at least some researchers who have excluded participants do not report it. Another study found that reporting an intention-to-treat analysis was associated with other aspects of good study design and reporting, such as describing a sample size calculation.", "Example 1": "The primary analysis was intention-to-treat and involved all patients who were randomly assigned.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 27, "EQ_number": 5.03, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Reporting numbers and statistics", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "17a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Outcomes and estimation", "RG Checklist text": "For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each group, and the estimated effect size and its precision (such as 95% confidence interval)", "text_long": "For each outcome, study results should be reported as a summary of the outcome in each group (for example, the number of participants with or without the event and the denominators, or the mean and standard deviation of measurements), together with the contrast between the groups, known as the effect size. For binary outcomes, the effect size could be the risk ratio (relative risk), odds ratio, or risk difference; for survival time data, it could be the hazard ratio or difference in median survival time; and for continuous data, it is usually the difference in means. Confidence intervals should be presented for the contrast between groups. A common error is the presentation of separate confidence intervals for the outcome in each group rather than for the treatment effect.233 Trial results are often more clearly displayed in a table rather than in the text, as shown in tables 5\u200b5 and 6\u200b6.\n\nFor all outcomes, authors should provide a confidence interval to indicate the precision (uncertainty) of the estimate.48 235 A 95% confidence interval is conventional, but occasionally other levels are used. Many journals require or strongly encourage the use of confidence intervals.236 They are especially valuable in relation to differences that do not meet conventional statistical significance, for which they often indicate that the result does not rule out an important clinical difference. The use of confidence intervals has increased markedly in recent years, although not in all medical specialties.233 Although P values may be provided in addition to confidence intervals, results should not be reported solely as P values.237 238 Results should be reported for all planned primary and secondary end points, not just for analyses that were statistically significant or \u201cinteresting.\u201d Selective reporting within a study is a widespread and serious problem.55 57 In trials in which interim analyses were performed, interpretation should focus on the final results at the close of the trial, not the interim results.239\n\nFor both binary and survival time data, expressing the results also as the number needed to treat for benefit or harm can be helpful (see item 21).", "Example 1": "Example of reporting of summary results for each study group (binary outcomes).* (Adapted from table 2 of Mease et al103) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844943/table/tbl5/", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 28, "EQ_number": 5.03, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Reporting numbers and statistics", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "17b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "CONSORT", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Outcomes and estimation", "RG Checklist text": "For binary outcomes, presentation of both absolute and relative effect sizes is recommended", "text_long": "When the primary outcome is binary, both the relative effect (risk ratio (relative risk) or odds ratio) and the absolute effect (risk difference) should be reported (with confidence intervals), as neither the relative measure nor the absolute measure alone gives a complete picture of the effect and its implications.

For diseases where the outcome is common, a relative risk near unity might indicate clinically important differences in public health terms. In contrast, a large relative risk when the outcome is rare may not be so important for public health (although it may be important to an individual in a high risk category).", "Example 1": "The risk of oxygen dependence or death was reduced by 16% (95% CI 25% to 7%).

If subgroup analyses were undertaken, authors should report which subgroups were examined, why, if they were prespecified, and how many were prespecified. Selective reporting of subgroup analyses could lead to bias.248 When evaluating a subgroup the question is not whether the subgroup shows a statistically significant result but whether the subgroup treatment effects are significantly different from each other. To determine this, a test of interaction is helpful, although the power for such tests is typically low. If formal evaluations of interaction are undertaken (see item 12b) they should be reported as the estimated difference in the intervention effect in each subgroup (with a confidence interval), not just as P values.\n\nIn one survey, 35 of 50 trial reports included subgroup analyses, of which only 42% used tests of interaction.183 It was often difficult to determine whether subgroup analyses had been specified in the protocol. In another survey of surgical trials published in high impact journals, 27 of 72 trials reported 54 subgroup analyses, of which 91% were post hoc and only 6% of subgroup analyses used a test of interaction to assess whether a subgroup effect existed.249\n\nSimilar recommendations apply to analyses in which adjustment was made for baseline variables. If done, both unadjusted and adjusted analyses should be reported. Authors should indicate whether adjusted analyses, including the choice of variables to adjust for, were planned. Ideally, the trial protocol should state whether adjustment is made for nominated baseline variables by using analysis of covariance.187 Adjustment for variables because they differ significantly at baseline is likely to bias the estimated treatment effect.187 A survey found that unacknowledged discrepancies between protocols and publications were found for all 25 trials reporting subgroup analyses and for 23 of 28 trials reporting adjusted analyses.", "Example 1": "On the basis of a study that suggested perioperative \u03b2-blocker efficacy might vary across baseline risk, we prespecified our primary subgroup analysis on the basis of the revised cardiac risk index scoring system.

Randomised trials offer the best approach for providing safety data as well as efficacy data, although they cannot detect rare harms.\n\nMany reports of RCTs provide inadequate information on adverse events. A survey of 192 drug trials published from 1967 to 1999 showed that only 39% had adequate reporting of clinical adverse events and 29% had adequate reporting of laboratory defined toxicity.72 More recently, a comparison between the adverse event data submitted to the trials database of the National Cancer Institute, which sponsored the trials, and the information reported in journal articles found that low grade adverse events were underreported in journal articles. High grade events (Common Toxicity Criteria grades 3 to 5) were reported inconsistently in the articles, and the information regarding attribution to investigational drugs was incomplete.251 Moreover, a review of trials published in six general medical journals in 2006 to 2007 found that, although 89% of 133 reports mentioned adverse events, no information on severe adverse events and withdrawal of patients due to an adverse event was given on 27% and 48% of articles, respectively.252\n\nAn extension of the CONSORT statement has been developed to provide detailed recommendations on the reporting of harms in randomised trials.42 Recommendations and examples of appropriate reporting are freely available from the CONSORT website (www.consort-statement.org). They complement the CONSORT 2010 Statement and should be consulted, particularly if the study of harms was a key objective. Briefly, if data on adverse events were collected, events should be listed and defined, with reference to standardised criteria where appropriate. The methods used for data collection and attribution of events should be described.

Some journals have attempted to remedy this problem by encouraging more structure to authors\u2019 discussion of their results.255 256 For example, Annals of Internal Medicine recommends that authors structure the discussion section by presenting (1) a brief synopsis of the key findings, (2) consideration of possible mechanisms and explanations, (3) comparison with relevant findings from other published studies (whenever possible including a systematic review combining the results of the current study with the results of all previous relevant studies), (4) limitations of the present study (and methods used to minimise and compensate for those limitations), and (5) a brief section that summarises the clinical and research implications of the work, as appropriate.255 We recommend that authors follow these sensible suggestions, perhaps also using suitable subheadings in the discussion section.\n\nAlthough discussion of limitations is frequently omitted from research reports,257 identification and discussion of the weaknesses of a study have particular importance.258 For example, a surgical group reported that laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a technically difficult procedure, had significantly lower rates of complications than the more traditional open cholecystectomy for management of acute cholecystitis.259 However, the authors failed to discuss an obvious bias in their results. The study investigators had completed all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies, whereas 80% of the open cholecystectomies had been completed by trainees.\n\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including measurement of a primary outcome (see item 6a) or diagnosis (see item 4a). Perhaps the scale used was validated on an adult population but used in a paediatric one, or the assessor was not trained in how to administer the instrument.\n\nThe difference between statistical significance and clinical importance should always be borne in mind. Authors should particularly avoid the common error of interpreting a non-significant result as indicating equivalence of interventions. The confidence interval (see item 17a) provides valuable insight into whether the trial result is compatible with a clinically important effect, regardless of the P value.120\n\nAuthors should exercise special care when evaluating the results of trials with multiple comparisons.

There is no absolute external validity; the term is meaningful only with regard to clearly specified conditions that were not directly examined in the trial. Can results be generalised to an individual participant or groups that differ from those enrolled in the trial with regard to age, sex, severity of disease, and comorbid conditions? Are the results applicable to other drugs within a class of similar drugs, to a different dose, timing, and route of administration, and to different concomitant therapies? Can similar results be expected at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care? What about the effect on related outcomes that were not assessed in the trial, and the importance of length of follow-up and duration of treatment, especially with respect to harms?263\n\nExternal validity is a matter of judgment and depends on the characteristics of the participants included in the trial, the trial setting, the treatment regimens tested, and the outcomes assessed.5 136 It is therefore crucial that adequate information be described about eligibility criteria and the setting and location (see item 4b), the interventions and how they were administered (see item 5), the definition of outcomes (see item 6), and the period of recruitment and follow-up (see item 14). The proportion of control group participants in whom the outcome develops (control group risk) is also important. The proportion of eligible participants who refuse to enter the trial as indicated on the flowchart (see item 13) is relevant for the generalisability of the trial, as it may indicate preferences for or acceptability of an intervention. Similar considerations may apply to clinician preferences.264 265\n\nSeveral issues are important when results of a trial are applied to an individual patient.266 267 268 Although some variation in treatment response between an individual patient and the patients in a trial or systematic review is to be expected, the differences tend to be in magnitude rather than direction.\n\nAlthough there are important exceptions,268 therapies (especially drugs 269) found to be beneficial in a narrow range of patients generally have broader application in actual practice. Frameworks for the evaluation of external validity have been proposed, including qualitative studies, such as in integral \u201cprocess evaluations\u201d270 and checklists.271 Measures that incorporate baseline risk when calculating therapeutic effects, such as the number needed to treat to obtain one additional favourable outcome and the number needed to treat to produce one adverse effect, are helpful in assessing the benefit-to-risk balance in an individual patient or group with characteristics that differ from the typical trial participant.268 272 273 Finally, after deriving patient centred estimates for the potential benefit and harm from an intervention, the clinician must integrate them with the patient\u2019s values and preferences for therapy. Similar considerations apply when assessing the generalisability of results to different settings and interventions.", "Example 1": "As the intervention was implemented for both sexes, all ages, all types of sports, and at different levels of sports, the results indicate that the entire range of athletes, from young elite to intermediate and recreational senior athletes, would benefit from using the presented training programme for the prevention of recurrences of ankle sprain. By including non-medically treated and medically treated athletes, we covered a broad spectrum of injury severity.

By registering a randomised trial, authors typically report a minimal set of information and obtain a unique trial registration number.\n\nIn September 2004 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) changed their policy, saying that they would consider trials for publication only if they had been registered before the enrolment of the first participant.290 This resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of trials being registered.291 The ICMJE gives guidance on acceptable registries (www.icmje.org/faq.pdf).\n\nIn a recent survey of 165 high impact factor medical journals\u2019 instructions to authors, 44 journals specifically stated that all recent clinical trials must be registered as a requirement of submission to that journal.292\n\nAuthors should provide the name of the register and the trial\u2019s unique registration number.

Gortmaker et al found that US women who had been obese in late adolescence in 1981 were less likely to be married and had lower incomes seven years later than women who had not been overweight, while men who had been overweight were less likely to be married.4 Sargent et al found that UK women, but not men, who had been obese at 16 years in 1974 earned 7.4% less than their non-obese peers at age 23.5\nThe study of adult outcomes of childhood obesity is difficult because obesity often continues into adult life and therefore poorer socioeconomic and educational outcomes may actually reflect confounding by adult obesity. Yet identifying outcomes related to obesity confined childhood is important in determining whether people who are obese in childhood and who later lose weight remain at risk for adult adversity and inequalities.\nWe used longitudinal data from the 1970 British birth cohort to examine the adult socioeconomic, educational, social, and psychological outcomes of childhood obesity.

For example, authors should indicate that the study was a cohort study, which followed people over a particular time period, and describe the group of persons that comprised the cohort and their exposure status. Similarly, if the investigation used a case-control design, the cases and controls and their source population should be described. If the study was a cross-sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned. When a study is a variant of the three main study types, there is an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the example above [28].\n\nWe recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study \u2018prospective' or \u2018retrospective' because these terms are ill defined [29]. One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case-control studies [30]. A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study was developed [31]. A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases were selected [32]. Some advise against using these terms [33], or adopting the alternatives \u2018concurrent' and \u2018historical' for describing cohort studies [34]. In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and historical. We recommend that, whenever authors use these words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how and when data collection took place.\n\nThe first part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from a study. If a new report is in line with the original aims of the study, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlier publication and by briefly restating the salient features of the study. However, the aims of a study may also evolve over time. Researchers often use data for purposes for which they were not originally intended, including, for example, official vital statistics that were collected primarily for administrative purposes, items in questionnaires that originally were only included for completeness, or blood samples that were collected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and carotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutation in the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not of myocardial infarction or stroke [35]. The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important. However, briefly restating the original aims might help readers understand the context of the research and possible limitations in the data.", "Example 1": "We used a case-crossover design, a variation of a case-control design that is appropriate when a brief exposure (driver's phone use) causes a transient rise in the risk of a rare outcome (a crash). We compared a driver's use of a mobile phone at the estimated time of a crash with the same driver's use during another suitable time period. Because drivers are their own controls, the design controls for characteristics of the driver that may affect the risk of a crash but do not change over a short period of time. As it is important that risks during control periods and crash trips are similar, we compared phone activity during the hazard interval (time immediately before the crash) with phone activity during control intervals (equivalent times during which participants were driving but did not crash) in the previous week", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 6, "EQ_number": 4.02, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Setting and location", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 5, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Setting", "RG Checklist text": "Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection.\n\n", "text_long": "Readers need information on setting and locations to assess the context and generalisability of a study's results.

Investigators usually restrict a study population by defining clinical, demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants. Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis and comorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibility criteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey of observational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did not specify eligibility criteria [5].\n\nEligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from which the study population was selected (e.g., the general population of a region or country), and the method of recruitment (e.g., referral or self-selection through advertisements).\n\nKnowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized non-response and loss to follow-up and whether the procedures were similar for all participants, informs judgments about the validity of results. For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detect acute infections, readers needed to know the interval between blood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judge whether some infections likely were missed because the interval between blood tests was too long [41]. In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial bias due to unequal ascertainment of events or differences in non-response or loss to follow-up [42]. Accordingly, we advise that researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for all participants, and that they describe the completeness of ascertainment of variables (see also item 14).\n\nIn case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of their selection has major implications for study validity. In general, controls should reflect the population from which the cases arose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all with advantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from a general population, population roster sampling, random digit dialling, neighbourhood or friend controls are used. Neighbourhood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching on exposure [17]. Controls with other diseases may have advantages over population-based controls, in particular for hospital-based cases, because they better reflect the catchment population of a hospital, have greater comparability of recall and ease of recruitment. However, they can present problems if the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing or being hospitalized for the control condition(s) [43,44]. To remedy this problem often a mixture of the best defensible control diseases is used [45].", "Example 1": "**Cohort study:** Participants in the Iowa Women's Health Study were a random sample of all women ages 55 to 69 years derived from the state of Iowa automobile driver's license list in 1985, which represented approximately 94% of Iowa women in that age group.

Matching in cohort studies makes groups directly comparable for potential confounders and presents fewer intricacies than with case-control studies. For example, it is not necessary to take the matching into account for the estimation of the relative risk [48]. Because matching in cohort studies may increase statistical precision investigators might allow for the matching in their analyses and thus obtain narrower confidence intervals.\n\nIn case-control studies matching is done to increase a study's efficiency by ensuring similarity in the distribution of variables between cases and controls, in particular the distribution of potential confounding variables [48,49]. Because matching can be done in various ways, with one or more controls per case, the rationale for the choice of matching variables and the details of the method used should be described. Commonly used forms of matching are frequency matching (also called group matching) and individual matching. In frequency matching, investigators choose controls so that the distribution of matching variables becomes identical or similar to that of cases. Individual matching involves matching one or several controls to each case. Although intuitively appealing and sometimes useful, matching in case-control studies has a number of disadvantages, is not always appropriate, and needs to be taken into account in the analysis (see Box 2).\n\nEven apparently simple matching procedures may be poorly reported. For example, authors may state that controls were matched to cases \u2018within five years', or using \u2018five year age bands'. Does this mean that, if a case was 54 years old, the respective control needed to be in the five-year age band 50 to 54, or aged 49 to 59, which is within five years of age 54? If a wide (e.g., 10-year) age band is chosen, there is a danger of residual confounding by age (see also Box 4), for example because controls may then be younger than cases on average.\n\n", "Example 1": "**Cohort study:** For each patient who initially received a statin, we used propensity-based matching to identify one control who did not receive a statin according to the following protocol. First, propensity scores were calculated for each patient in the entire cohort on the basis of an extensive list of factors potentially related to the use of statins or the risk of sepsis. Second, each statin user was matched to a smaller pool of non-statin-users by sex, age (plus or minus 1 year), and index date (plus or minus 3 months). Third, we selected the control with the closest propensity score (within 0.2 SD) to each statin user in a 1:1 fashion and discarded the remaining controls.\n\n**Case-control study:** We aimed to select five controls for every case from among individuals in the study population who had no diagnosis of autism or other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) recorded in their general practice record and who were alive and registered with a participating practice on the date of the PDD diagnosis in the case.

It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of the reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity analyses (see items 12e and 17).\n\nIn addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected.

For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve; solutions such as randomising the order of interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may also arise if the compared groups are not given the same diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the same kind than another (see also item 9).", "Example 1": "Total caffeine intake was calculated primarily using US Department of Agriculture food composition sources. In these calculations, it was assumed that the content of caffeine was 137 mg per cup of coffee, 47 mg per cup of tea, 46 mg per can or bottle of cola beverage, and 7 mg per serving of chocolate candy. This method of measuring (caffeine) intake was shown to be valid in both the NHS I cohort and a similar cohort study of male health professionals (...)

It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example [64]. Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example [65]. Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible \u201cdrift\u201d in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.\n\nUnfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles [66]. A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in three psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias [67]. A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results [5].", "Example 1": "In most case-control studies of suicide, the control group comprises living individuals but we decided to have a control group of people who had died of other causes (\u2026). With a control group of deceased individuals, the sources of information used to assess risk factors are informants who have recently experienced the death of a family member or close associate - and are therefore more comparable to the sources of information in the suicide group than if living controls were used", "Example 2": "Detection bias could influence the association between Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) if women with T2DM were under closer ophthalmic surveillance than women without this condition.

Large samples are needed to distinguish a small association from no association. Small studies often provide valuable information, but wide confidence intervals may indicate that they contribute less to current knowledge in comparison with studies providing estimates with narrower confidence intervals. Also, small studies that show \u2018interesting' or \u2018statistically significant' associations are published more frequently than small studies that do not have \u2018significant' findings. While these studies may provide an early signal in the context of discovery, readers should be informed of their potential weaknesses.\n\nThe importance of sample size determination in observational studies depends on the context. If an analysis is performed on data that were already available for other purposes, the main question is whether the analysis of the data will produce results with sufficient statistical precision to contribute substantially to the literature, and sample size considerations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculation of sample size may be useful when planning a new study [75,76]. Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty than implied by the single number that is generally produced. For example, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or other assumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise, if not guesswork [77]. The precision obtained in the final analysis can often not be determined beforehand because it will be reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multivariable analyses [78], the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured [79], and the exclusion of some individuals.\n\nFew epidemiological studies explain or report deliberations about sample size [4,5]. We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the considerations that determined the study size (e.g., a fixed available sample, as in the first example above). If the observational study was stopped early when statistical significance was achieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers with post hoc justifications for study size or retrospective power calculations [77]. From the point of view of the reader, confidence intervals indicate the statistical precision that was ultimately obtained. It should be realized that confidence intervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncertainty that may be present in a study (see item 20).", "Example 1": "The number of cases in the area during the study period determined the sample size", "Example 2": "A survey of postnatal depression in the region had documented a prevalence of 19.8%.

For example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable (see Box 4). Grouping choices may have important consequences for later analyses [81,82]. We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of model fitting.\n\nInvestigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome [82\u201384]. Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest.\n\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied quantitative exposure variables [4]. In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only two reported checking for linearity. In another survey, of the psychological literature, dichotomization was justified in only 22 of 110 articles (20%) [85].", "Example 1": "Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8 are considered to be seriously injured.

Regardless, investigators should pre-determine analyses at least for the primary study objectives in a study protocol. Often additional analyses are needed, either instead of, or as well as, those originally envisaged, and these may sometimes be motivated by the data. When a study is reported, authors should tell readers whether particular analyses were suggested by data inspection. Even though the distinction between pre-specified and exploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authors should clarify reasons for particular analyses.\n\nIf groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possible confounding variables by stratification or by multivariable regression (see Box 5) [94]. Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohort studies [95]. whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies [96,97]. Analysts should fully describe specific procedures for variable selection and not only present results from the final model [98,99]. If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a final model, this process should be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or two covariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparent confounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses such as imputation procedures, data transformation, and calculations of attributable risks should also be described. Non-standard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statistical software used reported. As a guiding principle, we advise statistical methods be described \u201cwith enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results\u201d [100].\n\nIn an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated how continuous and multi-category variables were entered into the statistical model [101]. Another study found that among 67 articles in which statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders, it was mostly unclear how confounders were chosen [4].", "Example 1": "The adjusted relative risk was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel technique, when evaluating if confounding by age or gender was present in the groups compared.

Also, it is important to explain what methods were used to examine whether effects or associations differed across groups (see item 17).\n\nInteraction relates to the situation when one factor modifies the effect of another (therefore also called \u2018effect modification'). The joint action of two factors can be characterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of risk differences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relative risk (see Box 8). Many authors and readers may have their own preference about the way interactions should be analysed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent the joint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses absolute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinical decision making [105]. Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above [103]. A lay-out presenting separate effects of both exposures as well as their joint effect, each relative to no exposure, might be most informative.

We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in Box 6. We advise that authors report the number of missing values for each variable of interest (exposures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in the analysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values if possible, and indicate how many individuals were excluded because of missing data when describing the flow of participants through the study (see also item 13).

Among individuals who remain free of the disease at the end of their observation period, the amount of follow-up time is assumed to be unrelated to the probability of developing the outcome. This will be the case if follow-up ends on a fixed date or at a particular age. Loss to follow-up occurs when participants withdraw from a study before that date. This may hamper the validity of a study if loss to follow-up occurs selectively in exposed individuals, or in persons at high risk of developing the disease (\u2018informative censoring'). In the example above, patients lost to follow-up in treatment programmes with no active follow-up had fewer CD4 helper cells than those remaining under observation and were therefore at higher risk of dying [116].\n\nIt is important to distinguish persons who reach the end of the study from those lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, statistical software usually does not distinguish between the two situations: in both cases follow-up time is automatically truncated (\u2018censored') at the end of the observation period. Investigators therefore need to decide, ideally at the stage of planning the study, how they will deal with loss to follow-up. When few patients are lost, investigators may either exclude individuals with incomplete follow-up, or treat them as if they withdrew alive at either the date of loss to follow-up or the end of the study. We advise authors to report how many patients were lost to follow-up and what censoring strategies they used.", "Example 1": "In treatment programmes with active follow-up, those lost to follow-up and those followed-up at 1 year had similar baseline CD4 cell counts (median 115 cells per \u03bcL and 123 cells per \u03bcL), whereas patients lost to follow-up in programmes with no active follow-up procedures had considerably lower CD4 cell counts than those followed-up (median 64 cells per \u03bcL and 123 cells per \u03bcL).

A matched analysis is therefore often necessary. This can intuitively be understood as a stratified analysis: each case is seen as one stratum with his or her set of matched controls. The analysis rests on considering whether the case is more often exposed than the controls, despite having made them alike regarding the matching variables. Investigators can do such a stratified analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method on a \u2018matched' 2 by 2 table. In its simplest form the odds ratio becomes the ratio of pairs that are discordant for the exposure variable. If matching was done for variables like age and sex that are universal attributes, the analysis needs not retain the individual, person-to-person matching: a simple analysis in categories of age and sex is sufficient [50]. For other matching variables, such as neighbourhood, sibship, or friendship, however, each matched set should be considered its own stratum.\n\nIn individually matched studies, the most widely used method of analysis is conditional logistic regression, in which each case and their controls are considered together. The conditional method is necessary when the number of controls varies among cases, and when, in addition to the matching variables, other variables need to be adjusted for. To allow readers to judge whether the matched design was appropriately taken into account in the analysis, we recommend that authors describe in detail what statistical methods were used to analyse the data. If taking the matching into account does have little effect on the estimates, authors may choose to present an unmatched analysis.", "Example 1": "We used McNemar's test, paired t test, and conditional logistic regression analysis to compare dementia patients with their matched controls for cardiovascular risk factors, the occurrence of spontaneous cerebral emboli, carotid disease, and venous to arterial circulation shunt", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 19, "EQ_number": 4.048, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Design specific methods", "display_number": "12diii", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Statistical methods", "RG Checklist text": "**Cross-sectional study:** If applicable, describe analytical methods taking account of sampling strategy.", "text_long": "Most cross-sectional studies use a pre-specified sampling strategy to select participants from a source population. Sampling may be more complex than taking a simple random sample, however. It may include several stages and clustering of participants (e.g., in districts or villages). Proportionate stratification may ensure that subgroups with a specific characteristic are correctly represented. Disproportionate stratification may be useful to over-sample a subgroup of particular interest.\n\nAn estimate of association derived from a complex sample may be more or less precise than that derived from a simple random sample. Measures of precision such as standard error or confidence interval should be corrected using the design effect, a ratio measure that describes how much precision is gained or lost if a more complex sampling strategy is used instead of simple random sampling [119]. Most complex sampling techniques lead to a decrease of precision, resulting in a design effect greater than 1.\n\nWe advise that authors clearly state the method used to adjust for complex sampling strategies so that readers may understand how the chosen sampling method influenced the precision of the obtained estimates. For instance, with clustered sampling, the implicit trade-off between easier data collection and loss of precision is transparent if the design effect is reported. In the example, the calculated design effects of 1.9 for men indicates that the actual sample size would need to be 1.9 times greater than with simple random sampling for the resulting estimates to have equal precision.", "Example 1": "The standard errors (SE) were calculated using the Taylor expansion method to estimate the sampling errors of estimators based on the complex sample design.

Issues that may be examined include the criteria for inclusion in analyses, the definitions of exposures or outcomes [122], which confounding variables merit adjustment, the handling of missing data [120,123], possible selection bias or bias from inaccurate or inconsistent measurement of exposure, disease and other variables, and specific analysis choices, such as the treatment of quantitative variables (see item 11). Sophisticated methods are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several biases or assumptions [124\u2013126].\n\nIn 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers [127]. This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power lines [128]. More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or information bias required to distort an association. One important, perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are present.", "Example 1": "Because we had a relatively higher proportion of \u2018missing' dead patients with insufficient data (38/148=25.7%) as compared to live patients (15/437=3.4%) (\u2026), it is possible that this might have biased the results. We have, therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We have assumed that the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in the study group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4% for live patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios: either all the exposed missing patients used second generation pills or they all used third-generation pills", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 21, "EQ_number": 5.011, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant numbers and flow", "display_number": "13a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "Results", "RG checklist heading 2": "Participants", "RG Checklist text": "Report the numbers of individuals at each stage of the study\u2014e.g., numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed; Consider use of a flow diagram.", "text_long": "Detailed information on the process of recruiting study participants is important for several reasons. Those included in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied. This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused [130]. These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such response bias (see Box 3) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies [131,132], was explained by differential participation of young women in case and control groups. Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than those with unhealthy children [133]. Although low participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study, transparent information on participation and reasons for non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated such proportions [134].\n\nIdeally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants, from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of participants' data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study, this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and control groups [135]. Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods [136].\n\nA recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies (59%) [137]. Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and non-participation in epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the literature [4,5]. Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades [137,138], which underscores the need for transparent reporting [139].", "Example 1": "Of the 105 freestanding bars and taverns sampled, 13 establishments were no longer in business and 9 were located in restaurants, leaving 83 eligible businesses.

Information about potential confounders, including whether and how they were measured, influences judgments about study validity. We advise authors to summarize continuous variables for each study group by giving the mean and standard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetrical distribution, as is often the case, the median and percentile range (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make up a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be presented as continuous variables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions for each category (see also Box 4). In studies that compare groups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should be given by group, as in the example above.\n\nInferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important [144,145].\n\nIn cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential confounders. Authors could present this information in a table with columns for participants in two or more exposure categories, which permits to judge the differences in confounders between these categories.\n\nIn case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control persons represent the source population and will usually be different from the cases in many respects. For example, in a study of oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample of young women with infarction more often had risk factors for that disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and a positive family history, than the control group [146]. This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guided by the presence of these risk factors\u2014e.g., because the risk factors were only established after the event (see also Box 5). In case-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed and non-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as is done in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the source population of the cases: if the control group is large enough and represents the source population, exposed and unexposed controls can be compared for potential confounders [121,147].", "Example 1": "Table: Characteristics of the Study Base at Enrolment, Castellana G (Italy) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2020496/table/pmed-0040297-t002/(", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 25, "EQ_number": 5.014, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Missing participant data", "display_number": "14b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Indicate the number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest.", "text_long": "As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also item 12c and Box 6).

We advise giving the unadjusted analyses together with the main data, for example the number of cases and controls that were exposed or not. This allows the reader to understand the data behind the measures of association (see also item 15). For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing values in covariates (see also item 12c). Estimates should be given with confidence intervals.\n\nReaders can compare unadjusted measures of association with those adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what direction, they changed. Readers may think that \u2018adjusted' results equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see Box 5). Thus, great care should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in the statistical model (see also item 20) [157,158].\n\nAuthors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models. Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations. Inappropriate decisions may introduce bias, for example by including variables that are in the causal pathway between exposure and disease (unless the aim is to asses how much of the effect is carried by the intermediary variable). If the decision to include a variable in the model was based on the change in the estimate, it is important to report what change was considered sufficiently important to justify its inclusion. If a \u2018backward deletion' or \u2018forward inclusion' strategy was used to select confounders, explain that process and give the significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis of no confounding. Of note, we and others do not advise selecting confounders based solely on statistical significance testing [147,159,160].\n\nRecent studies of the quality of reporting of epidemiological studies found that confidence intervals were reported in most articles [4]. However, few authors explained their choice of confounding variables [4,5].", "Example 1": "We initially considered the following variables as potential confounders by Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis: (\u2026) The variables we included in the final logistic regression models were those (\u2026) that produced a 10% change in the odds ratio after the Mantel-Haenszel adjustment", "Example 2": "Table: Relative Rates of Rehospitalisation by Treatment in Patients in Community Care after First Hospitalisation due to Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2020496/table/pmed-0040297-t008/)", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 29, "EQ_number": 5.022, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Continuous variable boundaries", "display_number": "16b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Main results", "RG Checklist text": "Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorised", "text_long": "Categorizing continuous data has several important implications for analysis (see Box 4) and also affects the presentation of results.

Details of the categories used may aid comparison of studies and meta-analysis. If data were grouped using conventional cut-points, such as body mass index thresholds [162], group boundaries (i.e., range of values) can be derived easily, except for the highest and lowest categories. If quantile-derived categories are used, the category boundaries cannot be inferred from the data. As a minimum, authors should report the category boundaries; it is helpful also to report the range of the data and the mean or median values within categories.\n", "Example 1": "Table: Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Cord Serum (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2020496/table/pmed-0040297-t005/) ", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 30, "EQ_number": 5.023, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Absolute risk estimates", "display_number": "16c", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Main results", "RG Checklist text": "If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period", "text_long": "The results from studies examining the association between an exposure and a disease are commonly reported in relative terms, as ratios of risks, rates or odds (see Box 8). Relative measures capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confounding [164,165]. Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially between these countries [166,167]. In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio [168].\n\nWidely used statistical models, including logistic [169] and proportional hazards (Cox) regression [170] are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI, see item 12b and Box 8), can be estimated in models based on ratio measures.\n\nIn many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years [163]. Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship between a risk factor and disease (also see Box 7) [171]. Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used [172].\n\nA recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohort studies [173]. A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31 [174].", "Example 1": "10 years' use of HRT [hormone replacement therapy] is estimated to result in five (95% CI 3\u20137) additional breast cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-only preparations and 19 (15\u201323) additional cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-progestagen combinations", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 31, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": 17, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Other analyses", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "In addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specific subgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, the calculation of attributable risks, or use alternative definitions of study variables in sensitivity analyses.\n\nThere is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in general [4,104]. In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specific associations, or effect-measure modification, when overall results appear to suggest little or no effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploring whether an overall association appears consistent across several, preferably pre-specified subgroups especially when a study is large enough to have sufficient data in each subgroup. A second area of debate is about interesting subgroups that arose during the data analysis. They might be important findings, but might also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possible nor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analyses done as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent the early exciting findings stand the test of time [9]. We advise authors to report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4, 12b and 20). This will allow readers to judge the implications of multiplicity, taking into account the study's position on the continuum from discovery to verification or refutation.\n\nA third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also item 12b and Box 8)? A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect\u2014if possible in a table, as in the first example above [183], or in the study by Martinelli et al. [185]. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in Box 8). Confidence intervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an association differs across subgroups.\n\nSensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate the robustness of the findings to missing data or possible biases (see also item 12b). Judgement is needed regarding the level of reporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses were performed, it may be impractical to present detailed findings for them all. It may sometimes be sufficient to report that sensitivity analyses were carried out and that they were consistent with the main results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriate if the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimates vary considerably [59,186].\n\nPocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. The majority claimed differences across groups but only eight articles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see item 12b) [4].", "Example 1": "Analysis of Oral Contraceptive Use, Presence of Factor V Leiden Allele, and Risk for Venous Thromboembolism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2020496/table/pmed-0040297-t009/)", "Example 2": "Sensitivity of the Rate Ratio for Cardiovascular Outcome to an Unmeasured Confounder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2020496/table/pmed-0040297-t010/)", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 32, "EQ_number": 6.01, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Key results", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 18, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "Discussion", "RG checklist heading 2": "Key results", "RG Checklist text": "Summarise key results with reference to study objectives", "text_long": "It is good practice to begin the discussion with a short summary of the main findings of the study.

It is important not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the relative importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias (see also item 9 and Box 3).\n\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item 8). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as \u2018attenuation' [201,202], or more recently as \u2018regression dilution bias' [203]. However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with them can be biased towards or away from unity [204\u2013206].\n\nWhen discussing limitations, authors may compare the study being presented with other studies in the literature in terms of validity, generalisability and precision. In this approach, each study can be viewed as contribution to the literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and action [207]. Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A survey of authors who had published original research articles in The Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study were reported by the investigators in the survey questionnaires, but not in the published article [192].", "Example 1": "Since the prevalence of counseling increases with increasing levels of obesity, our estimates may overestimate the true prevalence. Telephone surveys also may overestimate the true prevalence of counseling. Although persons without telephones have similar levels of overweight as persons with telephones, persons without telephones tend to be less educated, a factor associated with lower levels of counseling in our study. Also, of concern is the potential bias caused by those who refused to participate as well as those who refused to respond to questions about weight. Furthermore, because data were collected cross-sectionally, we cannot infer that counseling preceded a patient's attempt to lose weight", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 34, "EQ_number": 6.03, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Application", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 20, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Interpretation", "RG Checklist text": "Give a cautious overall interpretation considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.", "text_long": "The heart of the discussion section is the interpretation of a study's results. Over-interpretation is common and human: even when we try hard to give an objective assessment, reviewers often rightly point out that we went too far in some respects. When interpreting results, authors should consider the nature of the study on the discovery to verification continuum and potential sources of bias, including loss to follow-up and non-participation (see also items 9, 12 and 19). Due consideration should be given to confounding (item 16a), the results of relevant sensitivity analyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroup analyses (item 17). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise measurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with many health outcomes and often differs between groups being compared. Variables used to measure SES (income, education, or occupation) are surrogates for other undefined and unmeasured exposures, and the true confounder will by definition be measured with error [208]. Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statistical uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals. The latter do not take into account other uncertainties that arise from a study's design, implementation, and methods of measurement [209].\n\nTo guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may find criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965 helpful [164]. How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association consistently observed in different studies and settings? Is there supporting evidence from experimental studies, including laboratory and animal studies? How specific is the exposure's putative effect, and is there a dose-response relationship? Is the association biologically plausible? These criteria should not, however, be applied mechanically. For example, some have argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should be ignored [210,211]. This is a reversal of the point by Cornfield et al. about the strength of large relative risks (see item 12b) [127]. Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious. For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhood leukaemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because it concerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for which no alternative explanations are obvious [212]. Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating 2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, since dietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestyle factors as well as SES [213]. In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic findings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives was greatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in a randomised cross-over trial [214]. A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important for studies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authors should put their results in context with similar studies and explain how the new study affects the existing body of evidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review.", "Example 1": "Any explanation for an association between death from myocardial infarction and use of second generation oral contraceptives must be conjectural. There is no published evidence to suggest a direct biologic mechanism, and there are no other epidemiologic studies with relevant results. (\u2026) The increase in absolute risk is very small and probably applies predominantly to smokers.

Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient's HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005.\nResults: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379,872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22,744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2,689,287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period.

Gortmaker et al found that US women who had been obese in late adolescence in 1981 were less likely to be married and had lower incomes seven years later than women who had not been overweight, while men who had been overweight were less likely to be married.4 Sargent et al found that UK women, but not men, who had been obese at 16 years in 1974 earned 7.4% less than their non-obese peers at age 23.5\nThe study of adult outcomes of childhood obesity is difficult because obesity often continues into adult life and therefore poorer socioeconomic and educational outcomes may actually reflect confounding by adult obesity. Yet identifying outcomes related to obesity confined childhood is important in determining whether people who are obese in childhood and who later lose weight remain at risk for adult adversity and inequalities.\nWe used longitudinal data from the 1970 British birth cohort to examine the adult socioeconomic, educational, social, and psychological outcomes of childhood obesity.

For example, authors should indicate that the study was a cohort study, which followed people over a particular time period, and describe the group of persons that comprised the cohort and their exposure status. Similarly, if the investigation used a case-control design, the cases and controls and their source population should be described. If the study was a cross-sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned. When a study is a variant of the three main study types, there is an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the example above [28].\n\nWe recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study \u2018prospective' or \u2018retrospective' because these terms are ill defined [29]. One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case-control studies [30]. A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study was developed [31]. A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases were selected [32]. Some advise against using these terms [33], or adopting the alternatives \u2018concurrent' and \u2018historical' for describing cohort studies [34]. In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and historical. We recommend that, whenever authors use these words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how and when data collection took place.\n\nThe first part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from a study. If a new report is in line with the original aims of the study, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlier publication and by briefly restating the salient features of the study. However, the aims of a study may also evolve over time. Researchers often use data for purposes for which they were not originally intended, including, for example, official vital statistics that were collected primarily for administrative purposes, items in questionnaires that originally were only included for completeness, or blood samples that were collected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and carotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutation in the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not of myocardial infarction or stroke [35]. The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important. However, briefly restating the original aims might help readers understand the context of the research and possible limitations in the data.", "Example 1": "We used a case-crossover design, a variation of a case-control design that is appropriate when a brief exposure (driver's phone use) causes a transient rise in the risk of a rare outcome (a crash). We compared a driver's use of a mobile phone at the estimated time of a crash with the same driver's use during another suitable time period. Because drivers are their own controls, the design controls for characteristics of the driver that may affect the risk of a crash but do not change over a short period of time. As it is important that risks during control periods and crash trips are similar, we compared phone activity during the hazard interval (time immediately before the crash) with phone activity during control intervals (equivalent times during which participants were driving but did not crash) in the previous week", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 6, "EQ_number": 4.02, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Setting and location", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 5, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Setting", "RG Checklist text": "Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection", "text_long": "Readers need information on setting and locations to assess the context and generalisability of a study's results.

Information about location may refer to the countries, towns, hospitals or practices where the investigation took place. We advise stating dates rather than only describing the length of time periods. There may be different sets of dates for exposure, disease occurrence, recruitment, beginning and end of follow-up, and data collection.

Investigators usually restrict a study population by defining clinical, demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants. Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis and comorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibility criteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey of observational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did not specify eligibility criteria [5].\n\nEligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from which the study population was selected (e.g., the general population of a region or country), and the method of recruitment (e.g., referral or self-selection through advertisements).\n\nKnowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized non-response and loss to follow-up and whether the procedures were similar for all participants, informs judgments about the validity of results. For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detect acute infections, readers needed to know the interval between blood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judge whether some infections likely were missed because the interval between blood tests was too long [41]. In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial bias due to unequal ascertainment of events or differences in non-response or loss to follow-up [42]. Accordingly, we advise that researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for all participants, and that they describe the completeness of ascertainment of variables (see also item 14).\n\nIn case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of their selection has major implications for study validity. In general, controls should reflect the population from which the cases arose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all with advantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from a general population, population roster sampling, random digit dialling, neighbourhood or friend controls are used. Neighbourhood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching on exposure [17]. Controls with other diseases may have advantages over population-based controls, in particular for hospital-based cases, because they better reflect the catchment population of a hospital, have greater comparability of recall and ease of recruitment. However, they can present problems if the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing or being hospitalized for the control condition(s) [43,44]. To remedy this problem often a mixture of the best defensible control diseases is used [45].", "Example 1": "Cutaneous melanoma cases diagnosed in 1999 and 2000 were ascertained through the Iowa Cancer Registry (\u2026). Controls, also identified through the Iowa Cancer Registry, were colorectal cancer patients diagnosed during the same time.

Matching in cohort studies makes groups directly comparable for potential confounders and presents fewer intricacies than with case-control studies. For example, it is not necessary to take the matching into account for the estimation of the relative risk [48]. Because matching in cohort studies may increase statistical precision investigators might allow for the matching in their analyses and thus obtain narrower confidence intervals.\n\nIn case-control studies matching is done to increase a study's efficiency by ensuring similarity in the distribution of variables between cases and controls, in particular the distribution of potential confounding variables [48,49]. Because matching can be done in various ways, with one or more controls per case, the rationale for the choice of matching variables and the details of the method used should be described. Commonly used forms of matching are frequency matching (also called group matching) and individual matching. In frequency matching, investigators choose controls so that the distribution of matching variables becomes identical or similar to that of cases. Individual matching involves matching one or several controls to each case. Although intuitively appealing and sometimes useful, matching in case-control studies has a number of disadvantages, is not always appropriate, and needs to be taken into account in the analysis", "Example 1": "We aimed to select five controls for every case from among individuals in the study population who had no diagnosis of autism or other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) recorded in their general practice record and who were alive and registered with a participating practice on the date of the PDD diagnosis in the case. Controls were individually matched to cases by year of birth (up to 1 year older or younger), sex, and general practice. For each of 300 cases, five controls could be identified who met all the matching criteria.

This applies to criteria for cases in a case-control study, disease events during follow-up in a cohort study and prevalent disease in a cross-sectional study. Clear definitions and steps taken to adhere to them are particularly important for any disease condition of primary interest in the study.\n\nFor some studies, \u2018determinant' or \u2018predictor' may be appropriate terms for exposure variables and outcomes may be called \u2018endpoints'. In multivariable models, authors sometimes use \u2018dependent variable' for an outcome and \u2018independent variable' or \u2018explanatory variable' for exposure and confounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does not distinguish exposures from confounders.\n\nIf many variables have been measured and included in exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, consider providing a list with details on each variable in an appendix, additional table or separate publication. Of note, the International Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new section with \u2018cohort profiles', that includes detailed information on what was measured at different points in time in particular studies [56,57]. Finally, we advise that authors declare all \u2018candidate variables' considered for statistical analysis, rather than selectively reporting only those included in the final models (see also item 16a) [58,59]", "Example 1": "Only major congenital malformations were included in the analyses.

Measurement error and misclassification of exposures or outcomes can make it more difficult to detect cause-effect relationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error in measurement of potential confounders can increase the risk of residual confounding [62,63]. It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of the reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity analyses (see items 12e and 17).\n\nIn addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected. This may be important for laboratory examinations (as in the second example) and other situations. For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve; solutions such as randomising the order of interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may also arise if the compared groups are not given the same diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the same kind than another (see also item 9).", "Example 1": "Samples pertaining to matched cases and controls were always analyzed together in the same batch and laboratory personnel were unable to distinguish among cases and controls", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 11, "EQ_number": 4.04, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 9, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Bias", "RG Checklist text": "Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias", "text_long": "Biased studies produce results that differ systematically from the truth (see also Box 3). It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example [64]. Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example [65]. Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible \u201cdrift\u201d in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.\n\nUnfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles [66]. A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in three psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias [67]. A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results", "Example 1": "In most case-control studies of suicide, the control group comprises living individuals but we decided to have a control group of people who had died of other causes (\u2026).

Large samples are needed to distinguish a small association from no association. Small studies often provide valuable information, but wide confidence intervals may indicate that they contribute less to current knowledge in comparison with studies providing estimates with narrower confidence intervals. Also, small studies that show \u2018interesting' or \u2018statistically significant' associations are published more frequently than small studies that do not have \u2018significant' findings. While these studies may provide an early signal in the context of discovery, readers should be informed of their potential weaknesses.\n\nThe importance of sample size determination in observational studies depends on the context. If an analysis is performed on data that were already available for other purposes, the main question is whether the analysis of the data will produce results with sufficient statistical precision to contribute substantially to the literature, and sample size considerations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculation of sample size may be useful when planning a new study. Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty than implied by the single number that is generally produced. For example, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or other assumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise, if not guesswork. The precision obtained in the final analysis can often not be determined beforehand because it will be reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multivariable analyses, the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured, and the exclusion of some individuals.\n\nFew epidemiological studies explain or report deliberations about sample size. We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the considerations that determined the study size (e.g., a fixed available sample, as in the first example above). If the observational study was stopped early when statistical significance was achieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers with post hoc justifications for study size or retrospective power calculations. From the point of view of the reader, confidence intervals indicate the statistical precision that was ultimately obtained. It should be realized that confidence intervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncertainty that may be present in a study (see item 20).", "Example 1": "A survey of postnatal depression in the region had documented a prevalence of 19.8%.

For example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable. Grouping choices may have important consequences for later analyses. We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of model fitting.\n\nInvestigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome. Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest.\n\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied quantitative exposure variables. In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only two reported checking for linearity. In another survey, of the psychological literature, dichotomization was justified in only 22 of 110 articles (20%)", "Example 1": "Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8 are considered to be seriously injured.

Regardless, investigators should pre-determine analyses at least for the primary study objectives in a study protocol. Often additional analyses are needed, either instead of, or as well as, those originally envisaged, and these may sometimes be motivated by the data. When a study is reported, authors should tell readers whether particular analyses were suggested by data inspection. Even though the distinction between pre-specified and exploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authors should clarify reasons for particular analyses.\n\nIf groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possible confounding variables by stratification or by multivariable regression (see Box 5) [94]. Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohort studies [95]. whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies [96,97]. Analysts should fully describe specific procedures for variable selection and not only present results from the final model [98,99]. If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a final model, this process should be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or two covariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparent confounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses such as imputation procedures, data transformation, and calculations of attributable risks should also be described. Non-standard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statistical software used reported. As a guiding principle, we advise statistical methods be described \u201cwith enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results\u201d [100].\n\nIn an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated how continuous and multi-category variables were entered into the statistical model [101]. Another study found that among 67 articles in which statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders, it was mostly unclear how confounders were chosen", "Example 1": "The adjusted relative risk was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel technique, when evaluating if confounding by age or gender was present in the groups compared.

Subgroup analyses are nevertheless often done [4]. Readers need to know which subgroup analyses were planned in advance, and which arose while analysing the data. Also, it is important to explain what methods were used to examine whether effects or associations differed across groups (see item 17).\n\nInteraction relates to the situation when one factor modifies the effect of another (therefore also called \u2018effect modification'). The joint action of two factors can be characterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of risk differences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relative risk (see Box 8). Many authors and readers may have their own preference about the way interactions should be analysed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent the joint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses absolute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinical decision making [105]. Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above [103]. A lay-out presenting separate effects of both exposures as well as their joint effect, each relative to no exposure, might be most informative. It is presented in the example for interaction under item 17, and the calculations on the different scales are explained in Box 8", "Example 1": "Sex differences in susceptibility to the 3 lifestyle-related risk factors studied were explored by testing for biological interaction according to Rothman: a new composite variable with 4 categories (a\u2212b\u2212, a\u2212b+, a+b\u2212, and a+b+) was redefined for sex and a dichotomous exposure of interest where a\u2212 and b\u2212 denote absence of exposure. RR was calculated for each category after adjustment for age. An interaction effect is defined as departure from additivity of absolute effects, and excess RR caused by interaction (RERI) was calculated:\n[calculation]\nwhere RR(a+b+) denotes RR among those exposed to both factors where RR(a\u2212b\u2212) is used as reference category (RR = 1.0).

Questionnaires posted to study participants are not always filled in completely, participants may not attend all follow-up visits and routine data sources and clinical databases are often incomplete. Despite its ubiquity and importance, few papers report in detail on the problem of missing data [5,107]. Investigators may use any of several approaches to address missing data. We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in Box 6. We advise that authors report the number of missing values for each variable of interest (exposures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in the analysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values if possible, and indicate how many individuals were excluded because of missing data when describing the flow of participants through the study (see also item 13). For analyses that account for missing data, authors should describe the nature of the analysis (e.g., multiple imputation) and the assumptions that were made (e.g., missing at random, see Box 6).", "Example 1": "Our missing data analysis procedures used missing at random (MAR) assumptions.

A matched analysis is therefore often necessary. This can intuitively be understood as a stratified analysis: each case is seen as one stratum with his or her set of matched controls. The analysis rests on considering whether the case is more often exposed than the controls, despite having made them alike regarding the matching variables. Investigators can do such a stratified analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method on a \u2018matched' 2 by 2 table. In its simplest form the odds ratio becomes the ratio of pairs that are discordant for the exposure variable. If matching was done for variables like age and sex that are universal attributes, the analysis needs not retain the individual, person-to-person matching: a simple analysis in categories of age and sex is sufficient [50]. For other matching variables, such as neighbourhood, sibship, or friendship, however, each matched set should be considered its own stratum.\n\nIn individually matched studies, the most widely used method of analysis is conditional logistic regression, in which each case and their controls are considered together. The conditional method is necessary when the number of controls varies among cases, and when, in addition to the matching variables, other variables need to be adjusted for. To allow readers to judge whether the matched design was appropriately taken into account in the analysis, we recommend that authors describe in detail what statistical methods were used to analyse the data. If taking the matching into account does have little effect on the estimates, authors may choose to present an unmatched analysis", "Example 1": "We used McNemar's test, paired t test, and conditional logistic regression analysis to compare dementia patients with their matched controls for cardiovascular risk factors, the occurrence of spontaneous cerebral emboli, carotid disease, and venous to arterial circulation shunt", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 18, "EQ_number": 4.046, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Statistical methods", "display_number": "12e", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Statistical methods", "RG Checklist text": "Describe any sensitivity analyses\n", "text_long": "Sensitivity analyses are useful to investigate whether or not the main results are consistent with those obtained with alternative analysis strategies or assumptions [121]. Issues that may be examined include the criteria for inclusion in analyses, the definitions of exposures or outcomes [122], which confounding variables merit adjustment, the handling of missing data [120,123], possible selection bias or bias from inaccurate or inconsistent measurement of exposure, disease and other variables, and specific analysis choices, such as the treatment of quantitative variables (see item 11). Sophisticated methods are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several biases or assumptions [124\u2013126].\n\nIn 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers [127]. This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power lines [128]. More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or information bias required to distort an association. One important, perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are present", "Example 1": "Because we had a relatively higher proportion of \u2018missing' dead patients with insufficient data (38/148=25.7%) as compared to live patients (15/437=3.4%) (\u2026), it is possible that this might have biased the results. We have, therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We have assumed that the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in the study group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4% for live patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios: either all the exposed missing patients used second generation pills or they all used third-generation pills", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 19, "EQ_number": 5.011, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant numbers and flow", "display_number": "13a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "Results", "RG checklist heading 2": "Participants", "RG Checklist text": "Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study\u2014eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed.

Those included in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied. This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused [130]. These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such response bias (see Box 3) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies [131,132], was explained by differential participation of young women in case and control groups. Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than those with unhealthy children [133]. Although low participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study, transparent information on participation and reasons for non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated such proportions [134].\n\nIdeally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants, from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of participants' data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study, this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and control groups [135]. Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods [136].\n\nA recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies (59%) [137]. Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and non-participation in epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the literature [4,5]. Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades [137,138], which underscores the need for transparent reporting", "Example 1": "Of the 105 freestanding bars and taverns sampled, 13 establishments were no longer in business and 9 were located in restaurants, leaving 83 eligible businesses. In 22 cases, the owner could not be reached by telephone despite 6 or more attempts. The owners of 36 bars declined study participation. (...) The 25 participating bars and taverns employed 124 bartenders, with 67 bartenders working at least 1 weekly daytime shift.

We advise authors to summarize continuous variables for each study group by giving the mean and standard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetrical distribution, as is often the case, the median and percentile range (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make up a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be presented as continuous variables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions for each category (see also Box 4). In studies that compare groups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should be given by group, as in the example above.\n\nInferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important.\n\nIn cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential confounders. Authors could present this information in a table with columns for participants in two or more exposure categories, which permits to judge the differences in confounders between these categories.\n\nIn case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control persons represent the source population and will usually be different from the cases in many respects. For example, in a study of oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample of young women with infarction more often had risk factors for that disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and a positive family history, than the control group [146]. This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guided by the presence of these risk factors\u2014e.g., because the risk factors were only established after the event (see also Box 5). In case-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed and non-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as is done in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the source population of the cases: if the control group is large enough and represents the source population, exposed and unexposed controls can be compared for potential confounders [121,147]", "Example 1": "Characteristics of the Study Base at Enrolment, Castellana G (Italy), 1985\u20131986\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040297.t002", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 23, "EQ_number": 5.013, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant characteristics", "display_number": "14b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Descriptive data", "RG Checklist text": "Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest\n", "text_long": "As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also item 12c and Box 6).

If the risk of an event changes over follow-up time, present the numbers and rates of events in appropriate intervals of follow-up or as a Kaplan-Meier life table or plot. It might be preferable to show plots as cumulative incidence that go up from 0% rather than down from 100%, especially if the event rate is lower than, say, 30% [153]. Consider presenting such information separately for participants in different exposure categories of interest.

For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing values in covariates (see also item 12c). Estimates should be given with confidence intervals.\n\nReaders can compare unadjusted measures of association with those adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what direction, they changed. Readers may think that \u2018adjusted' results equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see Box 5). Thus, great care should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in the statistical model (see also item 20) [157,158].\n\nAuthors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models. Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations. Inappropriate decisions may introduce bias, for example by including variables that are in the causal pathway between exposure and disease (unless the aim is to asses how much of the effect is carried by the intermediary variable).

If data were grouped using conventional cut-points, such as body mass index thresholds [162], group boundaries (i.e., range of values) can be derived easily, except for the highest and lowest categories. If quantile-derived categories are used, the category boundaries cannot be inferred from the data. As a minimum, authors should report the category boundaries; it is helpful also to report the range of the data and the mean or median values within categories.", "Example 1": "Table.

Relative measures capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confounding [164,165]. Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially between these countries [166,167]. In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio [168].\n\nWidely used statistical models, including logistic [169] and proportional hazards (Cox) regression [170] are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI, see item 12b and Box 8), can be estimated in models based on ratio measures.\n\nIn many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years [163]. Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship between a risk factor and disease (also see Box 7) [171]. Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used [172].\n\nA recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohort studies [173]. A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31 [174].", "Example 1": "10 years' use of HRT [hormone replacement therapy] is estimated to result in five (95% CI 3\u20137) additional breast cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-only preparations and 19 (15\u201323) additional cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-progestagen combinations", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 28, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": 17, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Other analyses", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "In addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specific subgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, the calculation of attributable risks, or use alternative definitions of study variables in sensitivity analyses.\n\nThere is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in general [4,104]. In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specific associations, or effect-measure modification, when overall results appear to suggest little or no effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploring whether an overall association appears consistent across several, preferably pre-specified subgroups especially when a study is large enough to have sufficient data in each subgroup. A second area of debate is about interesting subgroups that arose during the data analysis. They might be important findings, but might also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possible nor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analyses done as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent the early exciting findings stand the test of time [9]. We advise authors to report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4, 12b and 20). This will allow readers to judge the implications of multiplicity, taking into account the study's position on the continuum from discovery to verification or refutation.\n\nA third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also item 12b and Box 8)? A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect\u2014if possible in a table, as in the first example above [183], or in the study by Martinelli et al. [185]. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in Box 8). Confidence intervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an association differs across subgroups.\n\nSensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate the robustness of the findings to missing data or possible biases (see also item 12b). Judgement is needed regarding the level of reporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses were performed, it may be impractical to present detailed findings for them all. It may sometimes be sufficient to report that sensitivity analyses were carried out and that they were consistent with the main results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriate if the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimates vary considerably [59,186].\n\nPocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. The majority claimed differences across groups but only eight articles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see item 12b) [4].", "Example 1": "Table.

It is important not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the relative importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias (see also item 9 and Box 3).\n\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item 8). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as \u2018attenuation' [201,202], or more recently as \u2018regression dilution bias' [203]. However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with them can be biased towards or away from unity [204\u2013206].\n\nWhen discussing limitations, authors may compare the study being presented with other studies in the literature in terms of validity, generalisability and precision. In this approach, each study can be viewed as contribution to the literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and action [207]. Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A survey of authors who had published original research articles in The Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study were reported by the investigators in the survey questionnaires, but not in the published article", "Example 1": "Since the prevalence of counseling increases with increasing levels of obesity, our estimates may overestimate the true prevalence. Telephone surveys also may overestimate the true prevalence of counseling. Although persons without telephones have similar levels of overweight as persons with telephones, persons without telephones tend to be less educated, a factor associated with lower levels of counseling in our study. Also, of concern is the potential bias caused by those who refused to participate as well as those who refused to respond to questions about weight. Furthermore, because data were collected cross-sectionally, we cannot infer that counseling preceded a patient's attempt to lose weight", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 31, "EQ_number": 6.03, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Interpretation", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 20, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE case-control", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Interpretation", "RG Checklist text": "Give a cautious overall interpretation considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.", "text_long": "The heart of the discussion section is the interpretation of a study's results. Over-interpretation is common and human: even when we try hard to give an objective assessment, reviewers often rightly point out that we went too far in some respects. When interpreting results, authors should consider the nature of the study on the discovery to verification continuum and potential sources of bias, including loss to follow-up and non-participation (see also items 9, 12 and 19). Due consideration should be given to confounding (item 16a), the results of relevant sensitivity analyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroup analyses (item 17). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise measurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with many health outcomes and often differs between groups being compared. Variables used to measure SES (income, education, or occupation) are surrogates for other undefined and unmeasured exposures, and the true confounder will by definition be measured with error [208]. Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statistical uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals. The latter do not take into account other uncertainties that arise from a study's design, implementation, and methods of measurement [209].\n\nTo guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may find criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965 helpful [164]. How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association consistently observed in different studies and settings? Is there supporting evidence from experimental studies, including laboratory and animal studies? How specific is the exposure's putative effect, and is there a dose-response relationship? Is the association biologically plausible? These criteria should not, however, be applied mechanically. For example, some have argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should be ignored [210,211]. This is a reversal of the point by Cornfield et al. about the strength of large relative risks (see item 12b) [127]. Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious. For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhood leukaemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because it concerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for which no alternative explanations are obvious [212]. Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating 2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, since dietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestyle factors as well as SES [213]. In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic findings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives was greatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in a randomised cross-over trial [214]. A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important for studies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authors should put their results in context with similar studies and explain how the new study affects the existing body of evidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review.", "Example 1": "Any explanation for an association between death from myocardial infarction and use of second generation oral contraceptives must be conjectural. There is no published evidence to suggest a direct biologic mechanism, and there are no other epidemiologic studies with relevant results. (\u2026) The increase in absolute risk is very small and probably applies predominantly to smokers. Due to the lack of corroborative evidence, and because the analysis is based on relatively small numbers, more evidence on the subject is needed.

Can results be applied to an individual, groups or populations that differ from those enrolled in the study with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, severity of disease, and co-morbid conditions? Are the nature and level of exposures comparable, and the definitions of outcomes relevant to another setting or population? Are data that were collected in longitudinal studies many years ago still relevant today? Are results from health services research in one country applicable to health systems in other countries?\n\nThe question of whether the results of a study have external validity is often a matter of judgment that depends on the study setting, the characteristics of the participants, the exposures examined, and the outcomes assessed. Thus, it is crucial that authors provide readers with adequate information about the setting and locations, eligibility criteria, the exposures and how they were measured, the definition of outcomes, and the period of recruitment and follow-up. The degree of non-participation and the proportion of unexposed participants in whom the outcome develops are also relevant. Knowledge of the absolute risk and prevalence of the exposure, which will often vary across populations, are helpful when applying results to other settings and populations (see Box 7)", "Example 1": "How applicable are our estimates to other HIV-1-infected patients?

Similarly, if the investigation used a case-control design, the cases and controls and their source population should be described. If the study was a cross-sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned. When a study is a variant of the three main study types, there is an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the example above [28].\n\nWe recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study \u2018prospective' or \u2018retrospective' because these terms are ill defined [29]. One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case-control studies [30]. A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study was developed [31]. A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases were selected [32]. Some advise against using these terms [33], or adopting the alternatives \u2018concurrent' and \u2018historical' for describing cohort studies [34]. In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and historical. We recommend that, whenever authors use these words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how and when data collection took place.\n\nThe first part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from a study. If a new report is in line with the original aims of the study, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlier publication and by briefly restating the salient features of the study. However, the aims of a study may also evolve over time. Researchers often use data for purposes for which they were not originally intended, including, for example, official vital statistics that were collected primarily for administrative purposes, items in questionnaires that originally were only included for completeness, or blood samples that were collected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and carotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutation in the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not of myocardial infarction or stroke [35]. The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important. However, briefly restating the original aims might help readers understand the context of the research and possible limitations in the data.", "Example 1": "We used a case-crossover design, a variation of a case-control design that is appropriate when a brief exposure (driver's phone use) causes a transient rise in the risk of a rare outcome (a crash). We compared a driver's use of a mobile phone at the estimated time of a crash with the same driver's use during another suitable time period. Because drivers are their own controls, the design controls for characteristics of the driver that may affect the risk of a crash but do not change over a short period of time. As it is important that risks during control periods and crash trips are similar, we compared phone activity during the hazard interval (time immediately before the crash) with phone activity during control intervals (equivalent times during which participants were driving but did not crash) in the previous week", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 6, "EQ_number": 4.02, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Setting and location", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 5, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Setting", "RG Checklist text": "Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection", "text_long": "Readers need information on setting and locations to assess the context and generalisability of a study's results.

Investigators usually restrict a study population by defining clinical, demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants. Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis and comorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibility criteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey of observational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did not specify eligibility criteria [5].\n\nEligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from which the study population was selected (e.g., the general population of a region or country), and the method of recruitment (e.g., referral or self-selection through advertisements).\n\nKnowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized non-response and loss to follow-up and whether the procedures were similar for all participants, informs judgments about the validity of results. For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detect acute infections, readers needed to know the interval between blood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judge whether some infections likely were missed because the interval between blood tests was too long [41]. In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial bias due to unequal ascertainment of events or differences in non-response or loss to follow-up [42]. Accordingly, we advise that researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for all participants, and that they describe the completeness of ascertainment of variables (see also item 14).\n\nIn case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of their selection has major implications for study validity. In general, controls should reflect the population from which the cases arose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all with advantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from a general population, population roster sampling, random digit dialling, neighbourhood or friend controls are used. Neighbourhood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching on exposure [17]. Controls with other diseases may have advantages over population-based controls, in particular for hospital-based cases, because they better reflect the catchment population of a hospital, have greater comparability of recall and ease of recruitment. However, they can present problems if the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing or being hospitalized for the control condition(s) [43,44]. To remedy this problem often a mixture of the best defensible control diseases is used [45].", "Example 1": "Participants in the Iowa Women's Health Study were a random sample of all women ages 55 to 69 years derived from the state of Iowa automobile driver's license list in 1985, which represented approximately 94% of Iowa women in that age group.

Matching in cohort studies makes groups directly comparable for potential confounders and presents fewer intricacies than with case-control studies. For example, it is not necessary to take the matching into account for the estimation of the relative risk [48]. Because matching in cohort studies may increase statistical precision investigators might allow for the matching in their analyses and thus obtain narrower confidence intervals.\n\nIn case-control studies matching is done to increase a study's efficiency by ensuring similarity in the distribution of variables between cases and controls, in particular the distribution of potential confounding variables [48,49]. Because matching can be done in various ways, with one or more controls per case, the rationale for the choice of matching variables and the details of the method used should be described. Commonly used forms of matching are frequency matching (also called group matching) and individual matching. In frequency matching, investigators choose controls so that the distribution of matching variables becomes identical or similar to that of cases. Individual matching involves matching one or several controls to each case. Although intuitively appealing and sometimes useful, matching in case-control studies has a number of disadvantages, is not always appropriate, and needs to be taken into account in the analysis", "Example 1": "For each patient who initially received a statin, we used propensity-based matching to identify one control who did not receive a statin according to the following protocol. First, propensity scores were calculated for each patient in the entire cohort on the basis of an extensive list of factors potentially related to the use of statins or the risk of sepsis. Second, each statin user was matched to a smaller pool of non-statin-users by sex, age (plus or minus 1 year), and index date (plus or minus 3 months). Third, we selected the control with the closest propensity score (within 0.2 SD) to each statin user in a 1:1 fashion and discarded the remaining controls", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 9, "EQ_number": 4.06, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 7, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Variables", "RG Checklist text": "Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers.

Disease outcomes require adequately detailed description of the diagnostic criteria. This applies to criteria for cases in a case-control study, disease events during follow-up in a cohort study and prevalent disease in a cross-sectional study. Clear definitions and steps taken to adhere to them are particularly important for any disease condition of primary interest in the study.\n\nFor some studies, \u2018determinant' or \u2018predictor' may be appropriate terms for exposure variables and outcomes may be called \u2018endpoints'. In multivariable models, authors sometimes use \u2018dependent variable' for an outcome and \u2018independent variable' or \u2018explanatory variable' for exposure and confounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does not distinguish exposures from confounders.\n\nIf many variables have been measured and included in exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, consider providing a list with details on each variable in an appendix, additional table or separate publication. Of note, the International Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new section with \u2018cohort profiles', that includes detailed information on what was measured at different points in time in particular studies [56,57]. Finally, we advise that authors declare all \u2018candidate variables' considered for statistical analysis, rather than selectively reporting only those included in the final models (see also item 16a) [58,59]", "Example 1": "Only major congenital malformations were included in the analyses. Minor anomalies were excluded according to the exclusion list of European Registration of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT).

Measurement error and misclassification of exposures or outcomes can make it more difficult to detect cause-effect relationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error in measurement of potential confounders can increase the risk of residual confounding [62,63]. It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of the reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity analyses (see items 12e and 17).\n\nIn addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected. This may be important for laboratory examinations (as in the second example) and other situations. For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve; solutions such as randomising the order of interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may also arise if the compared groups are not given the same diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the same kind than another (see also item 9).", "Example 1": "Total caffeine intake was calculated primarily using US Department of Agriculture food composition sources. In these calculations, it was assumed that the content of caffeine was 137 mg per cup of coffee, 47 mg per cup of tea, 46 mg per can or bottle of cola beverage, and 7 mg per serving of chocolate candy.

It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example [64]. Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example [65]. Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible \u201cdrift\u201d in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.\n\nUnfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles [66]. A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in three psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias [67]. A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results", "Example 1": "Detection bias could influence the association between Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) if women with T2DM were under closer ophthalmic surveillance than women without this condition.

Large samples are needed to distinguish a small association from no association. Small studies often provide valuable information, but wide confidence intervals may indicate that they contribute less to current knowledge in comparison with studies providing estimates with narrower confidence intervals. Also, small studies that show \u2018interesting' or \u2018statistically significant' associations are published more frequently than small studies that do not have \u2018significant' findings. While these studies may provide an early signal in the context of discovery, readers should be informed of their potential weaknesses.\n\nThe importance of sample size determination in observational studies depends on the context. If an analysis is performed on data that were already available for other purposes, the main question is whether the analysis of the data will produce results with sufficient statistical precision to contribute substantially to the literature, and sample size considerations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculation of sample size may be useful when planning a new study. Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty than implied by the single number that is generally produced. For example, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or other assumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise, if not guesswork. The precision obtained in the final analysis can often not be determined beforehand because it will be reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multivariable analyses, the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured, and the exclusion of some individuals.\n\nFew epidemiological studies explain or report deliberations about sample size. We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the considerations that determined the study size (e.g., a fixed available sample, as in the first example above). If the observational study was stopped early when statistical significance was achieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers with post hoc justifications for study size or retrospective power calculations. From the point of view of the reader, confidence intervals indicate the statistical precision that was ultimately obtained. It should be realized that confidence intervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncertainty that may be present in a study (see item 20).", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 13, "EQ_number": 4.062, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "Analysis of quantitative variables", "display_number": 11, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Quantitative variables", "RG Checklist text": "Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses.

For example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable. Grouping choices may have important consequences for later analyses. We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of model fitting.\n\nInvestigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome. Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest.\n\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied quantitative exposure variables. In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only two reported checking for linearity.

Often additional analyses are needed, either instead of, or as well as, those originally envisaged, and these may sometimes be motivated by the data. When a study is reported, authors should tell readers whether particular analyses were suggested by data inspection. Even though the distinction between pre-specified and exploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authors should clarify reasons for particular analyses.\n\nIf groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possible confounding variables by stratification or by multivariable regression (see Box 5) [94]. Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohort studies [95]. whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies [96,97]. Analysts should fully describe specific procedures for variable selection and not only present results from the final model [98,99]. If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a final model, this process should be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or two covariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparent confounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses such as imputation procedures, data transformation, and calculations of attributable risks should also be described. Non-standard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statistical software used reported. As a guiding principle, we advise statistical methods be described \u201cwith enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results\u201d [100].\n\nIn an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated how continuous and multi-category variables were entered into the statistical model [101].

Also, it is important to explain what methods were used to examine whether effects or associations differed across groups (see item 17).\n\nInteraction relates to the situation when one factor modifies the effect of another (therefore also called \u2018effect modification'). The joint action of two factors can be characterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of risk differences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relative risk (see Box 8). Many authors and readers may have their own preference about the way interactions should be analysed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent the joint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses absolute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinical decision making [105]. Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above [103].

We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in Box 6. We advise that authors report the number of missing values for each variable of interest (exposures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in the analysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values if possible, and indicate how many individuals were excluded because of missing data when describing the flow of participants through the study (see also item 13).

Among individuals who remain free of the disease at the end of their observation period, the amount of follow-up time is assumed to be unrelated to the probability of developing the outcome. This will be the case if follow-up ends on a fixed date or at a particular age. Loss to follow-up occurs when participants withdraw from a study before that date. This may hamper the validity of a study if loss to follow-up occurs selectively in exposed individuals, or in persons at high risk of developing the disease (\u2018informative censoring'). In the example above, patients lost to follow-up in treatment programmes with no active follow-up had fewer CD4 helper cells than those remaining under observation and were therefore at higher risk of dying [116].\n\nIt is important to distinguish persons who reach the end of the study from those lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, statistical software usually does not distinguish between the two situations: in both cases follow-up time is automatically truncated (\u2018censored') at the end of the observation period. Investigators therefore need to decide, ideally at the stage of planning the study, how they will deal with loss to follow-up. When few patients are lost, investigators may either exclude individuals with incomplete follow-up, or treat them as if they withdrew alive at either the date of loss to follow-up or the end of the study. We advise authors to report how many patients were lost to follow-up and what censoring strategies they used", "Example 1": "In treatment programmes with active follow-up, those lost to follow-up and those followed-up at 1 year had similar baseline CD4 cell counts (median 115 cells per \u03bcL and 123 cells per \u03bcL), whereas patients lost to follow-up in programmes with no active follow-up procedures had considerably lower CD4 cell counts than those followed-up (median 64 cells per \u03bcL and 123 cells per \u03bcL).

Sophisticated methods are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several biases or assumptions [124\u2013126].\n\nIn 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers [127]. This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power lines [128]. More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or information bias required to distort an association. One important, perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are present", "Example 1": "Because we had a relatively higher proportion of \u2018missing' dead patients with insufficient data (38/148=25.7%) as compared to live patients (15/437=3.4%) (\u2026), it is possible that this might have biased the results. We have, therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We have assumed that the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in the study group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4% for live patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios: either all the exposed missing patients used second generation pills or they all used third-generation pills", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 19, "EQ_number": 5.011, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant numbers and flow", "display_number": "13a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "Results", "RG checklist heading 2": "Participants", "RG Checklist text": "Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study\u2014eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed.

Those included in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied. This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused [130]. These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such response bias (see Box 3) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies [131,132], was explained by differential participation of young women in case and control groups. Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than those with unhealthy children [133]. Although low participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study, transparent information on participation and reasons for non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated such proportions [134].\n\nIdeally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants, from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of participants' data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study, this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and control groups [135]. Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods [136].\n\nA recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies (59%) [137]. Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and non-participation in epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the literature [4,5]. Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades [137,138], which underscores the need for transparent reporting", "Example 1": "Of the 105 freestanding bars and taverns sampled, 13 establishments were no longer in business and 9 were located in restaurants, leaving 83 eligible businesses. In 22 cases, the owner could not be reached by telephone despite 6 or more attempts. The owners of 36 bars declined study participation. (...) The 25 participating bars and taverns employed 124 bartenders, with 67 bartenders working at least 1 weekly daytime shift.

Information about potential confounders, including whether and how they were measured, influences judgments about study validity. We advise authors to summarize continuous variables for each study group by giving the mean and standard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetrical distribution, as is often the case, the median and percentile range (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make up a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be presented as continuous variables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions for each category (see also Box 4). In studies that compare groups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should be given by group, as in the example above.\n\nInferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important.\n\nIn cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential confounders. Authors could present this information in a table with columns for participants in two or more exposure categories, which permits to judge the differences in confounders between these categories.\n\nIn case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control persons represent the source population and will usually be different from the cases in many respects. For example, in a study of oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample of young women with infarction more often had risk factors for that disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and a positive family history, than the control group [146]. This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guided by the presence of these risk factors\u2014e.g., because the risk factors were only established after the event (see also Box 5). In case-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed and non-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as is done in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the source population of the cases: if the control group is large enough and represents the source population, exposed and unexposed controls can be compared for potential confounders [121,147].", "Example 1": "Characteristics of the Study Base at Enrolment, Castellana G (Italy), 1985\u20131986\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040297.t002", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 23, "EQ_number": 5.013, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant characteristics", "display_number": "14b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Descriptive data", "RG Checklist text": "Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest\n", "text_long": "As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also item 12c and Box 6).

If the risk of an event changes over follow-up time, present the numbers and rates of events in appropriate intervals of follow-up or as a Kaplan-Meier life table or plot. It might be preferable to show plots as cumulative incidence that go up from 0% rather than down from 100%, especially if the event rate is lower than, say, 30% [153]. Consider presenting such information separately for participants in different exposure categories of interest. If a cohort study is investigating other time-related outcomes (e.g., quantitative disease markers such as blood pressure), present appropriate summary measures (e.g., means and standard deviations) over time, perhaps in a table or figure.\n\nFor cross-sectional studies, we recommend presenting the same type of information on prevalent outcome events or summary measures. For case-control studies, the focus will be on reporting exposures separately for cases and controls as frequencies or quantitative summaries [154].

We advise giving the unadjusted analyses together with the main data, for example the number of cases and controls that were exposed or not. This allows the reader to understand the data behind the measures of association (see also item 15). For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing values in covariates (see also item 12c). Estimates should be given with confidence intervals.\n\nReaders can compare unadjusted measures of association with those adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what direction, they changed. Readers may think that \u2018adjusted' results equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see Box 5). Thus, great care should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in the statistical model (see also item 20) [157,158].\n\nAuthors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models. Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations. Inappropriate decisions may introduce bias, for example by including variables that are in the causal pathway between exposure and disease (unless the aim is to asses how much of the effect is carried by the intermediary variable). If the decision to include a variable in the model was based on the change in the estimate, it is important to report what change was considered sufficiently important to justify its inclusion. If a \u2018backward deletion' or \u2018forward inclusion' strategy was used to select confounders, explain that process and give the significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis of no confounding. Of note, we and others do not advise selecting confounders based solely on statistical significance testing [147,159,160].\n\nRecent studies of the quality of reporting of epidemiological studies found that confidence intervals were reported in most articles [4].

Details of the categories used may aid comparison of studies and meta-analysis. If data were grouped using conventional cut-points, such as body mass index thresholds [162], group boundaries (i.e., range of values) can be derived easily, except for the highest and lowest categories.

Relative measures capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confounding [164,165]. Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially between these countries [166,167]. In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio [168].\n\nWidely used statistical models, including logistic [169] and proportional hazards (Cox) regression [170] are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI, see item 12b and Box 8), can be estimated in models based on ratio measures.\n\nIn many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years [163]. Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship between a risk factor and disease (also see Box 7) [171]. Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used [172].\n\nA recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohort studies [173]. A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31 [174].", "Example 1": "10 years' use of HRT [hormone replacement therapy] is estimated to result in five (95% CI 3\u20137) additional breast cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-only preparations and 19 (15\u201323) additional cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-progestagen combinations", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 29, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": 17, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Other analyses", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "In addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specific subgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, the calculation of attributable risks, or use alternative definitions of study variables in sensitivity analyses.\n\nThere is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in general [4,104]. In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specific associations, or effect-measure modification, when overall results appear to suggest little or no effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploring whether an overall association appears consistent across several, preferably pre-specified subgroups especially when a study is large enough to have sufficient data in each subgroup. A second area of debate is about interesting subgroups that arose during the data analysis. They might be important findings, but might also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possible nor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analyses done as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent the early exciting findings stand the test of time [9]. We advise authors to report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4, 12b and 20). This will allow readers to judge the implications of multiplicity, taking into account the study's position on the continuum from discovery to verification or refutation.\n\nA third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also item 12b and Box 8)? A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect\u2014if possible in a table, as in the first example above [183], or in the study by Martinelli et al. [185]. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in Box 8). Confidence intervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an association differs across subgroups.\n\nSensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate the robustness of the findings to missing data or possible biases (see also item 12b). Judgement is needed regarding the level of reporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses were performed, it may be impractical to present detailed findings for them all. It may sometimes be sufficient to report that sensitivity analyses were carried out and that they were consistent with the main results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriate if the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimates vary considerably [59,186].\n\nPocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. The majority claimed differences across groups but only eight articles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see item 12b) [4].", "Example 1": "Table.

Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item 8). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as \u2018attenuation' [201,202], or more recently as \u2018regression dilution bias' [203].

Due consideration should be given to confounding (item 16a), the results of relevant sensitivity analyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroup analyses (item 17). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise measurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with many health outcomes and often differs between groups being compared. Variables used to measure SES (income, education, or occupation) are surrogates for other undefined and unmeasured exposures, and the true confounder will by definition be measured with error [208]. Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statistical uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals. The latter do not take into account other uncertainties that arise from a study's design, implementation, and methods of measurement [209].\n\nTo guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may find criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965 helpful [164]. How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association consistently observed in different studies and settings? Is there supporting evidence from experimental studies, including laboratory and animal studies? How specific is the exposure's putative effect, and is there a dose-response relationship? Is the association biologically plausible? These criteria should not, however, be applied mechanically. For example, some have argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should be ignored [210,211]. This is a reversal of the point by Cornfield et al. about the strength of large relative risks (see item 12b) [127]. Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious. For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhood leukaemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because it concerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for which no alternative explanations are obvious [212]. Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating 2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, since dietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestyle factors as well as SES [213]. In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic findings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives was greatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in a randomised cross-over trial [214]. A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important for studies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authors should put their results in context with similar studies and explain how the new study affects the existing body of evidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review.", "Example 1": "Any explanation for an association between death from myocardial infarction and use of second generation oral contraceptives must be conjectural. There is no published evidence to suggest a direct biologic mechanism, and there are no other epidemiologic studies with relevant results. (\u2026) The increase in absolute risk is very small and probably applies predominantly to smokers. Due to the lack of corroborative evidence, and because the analysis is based on relatively small numbers, more evidence on the subject is needed. We would not recommend any change in prescribing practice on the strength of these results", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 33, "EQ_number": 6.04, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Application", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 21, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cohort", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Generalisability", "RG Checklist text": "Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results", "text_long": "Generalisability, also called external validity or applicability, is the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to other circumstances [216].

Can results be applied to an individual, groups or populations that differ from those enrolled in the study with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, severity of disease, and co-morbid conditions? Are the nature and level of exposures comparable, and the definitions of outcomes relevant to another setting or population? Are data that were collected in longitudinal studies many years ago still relevant today? Are results from health services research in one country applicable to health systems in other countries?\n\nThe question of whether the results of a study have external validity is often a matter of judgment that depends on the study setting, the characteristics of the participants, the exposures examined, and the outcomes assessed. Thus, it is crucial that authors provide readers with adequate information about the setting and locations, eligibility criteria, the exposures and how they were measured, the definition of outcomes, and the period of recruitment and follow-up. The degree of non-participation and the proportion of unexposed participants in whom the outcome develops are also relevant. Knowledge of the absolute risk and prevalence of the exposure, which will often vary across populations, are helpful when applying results to other settings and populations (see Box 7)", "Example 1": "How applicable are our estimates to other HIV-1-infected patients? This is an important question because the accuracy of prognostic models tends to be lower when applied to data other than those used to develop them.

Patients with HIV infection and corresponding persons from the general population were observed from the date of the patient's HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or 1 May 2005.\nResults: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379,872 persons from the general population were included in the study, yielding 22,744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2,689,287 (median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation. Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up.

For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age.\nLimitations: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years.\nConclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era.

Gortmaker et al found that US women who had been obese in late adolescence in 1981 were less likely to be married and had lower incomes seven years later than women who had not been overweight, while men who had been overweight were less likely to be married.4 Sargent et al found that UK women, but not men, who had been obese at 16 years in 1974 earned 7.4% less than their non-obese peers at age 23.5\nThe study of adult outcomes of childhood obesity is difficult because obesity often continues into adult life and therefore poorer socioeconomic and educational outcomes may actually reflect confounding by adult obesity. Yet identifying outcomes related to obesity confined childhood is important in determining whether people who are obese in childhood and who later lose weight remain at risk for adult adversity and inequalities.\nWe used longitudinal data from the 1970 British birth cohort to examine the adult socioeconomic, educational, social, and psychological outcomes of childhood obesity.

For example, authors should indicate that the study was a cohort study, which followed people over a particular time period, and describe the group of persons that comprised the cohort and their exposure status. Similarly, if the investigation used a case-control design, the cases and controls and their source population should be described. If the study was a cross-sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned. When a study is a variant of the three main study types, there is an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the example above [28].\n\nWe recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study \u2018prospective' or \u2018retrospective' because these terms are ill defined [29]. One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case-control studies [30]. A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study was developed [31]. A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases were selected [32]. Some advise against using these terms [33], or adopting the alternatives \u2018concurrent' and \u2018historical' for describing cohort studies [34]. In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and historical. We recommend that, whenever authors use these words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how and when data collection took place.\n\nThe first part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from a study. If a new report is in line with the original aims of the study, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlier publication and by briefly restating the salient features of the study. However, the aims of a study may also evolve over time. Researchers often use data for purposes for which they were not originally intended, including, for example, official vital statistics that were collected primarily for administrative purposes, items in questionnaires that originally were only included for completeness, or blood samples that were collected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and carotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutation in the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not of myocardial infarction or stroke [35]. The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important. However, briefly restating the original aims might help readers understand the context of the research and possible limitations in the data.", "Example 1": "We used a case-crossover design, a variation of a case-control design that is appropriate when a brief exposure (driver's phone use) causes a transient rise in the risk of a rare outcome (a crash). We compared a driver's use of a mobile phone at the estimated time of a crash with the same driver's use during another suitable time period. Because drivers are their own controls, the design controls for characteristics of the driver that may affect the risk of a crash but do not change over a short period of time. As it is important that risks during control periods and crash trips are similar, we compared phone activity during the hazard interval (time immediately before the crash) with phone activity during control intervals (equivalent times during which participants were driving but did not crash) in the previous week", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 6, "EQ_number": 4.02, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Setting and location", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 5, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Setting", "RG Checklist text": "Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection", "text_long": "Readers need information on setting and locations to assess the context and generalisability of a study's results.

Information about location may refer to the countries, towns, hospitals or practices where the investigation took place. We advise stating dates rather than only describing the length of time periods. There may be different sets of dates for exposure, disease occurrence, recruitment, beginning and end of follow-up, and data collection.

Investigators usually restrict a study population by defining clinical, demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants. Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis and comorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibility criteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey of observational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did not specify eligibility criteria [5].\n\nEligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from which the study population was selected (e.g., the general population of a region or country), and the method of recruitment (e.g., referral or self-selection through advertisements).\n\nKnowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized non-response and loss to follow-up and whether the procedures were similar for all participants, informs judgments about the validity of results. For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detect acute infections, readers needed to know the interval between blood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judge whether some infections likely were missed because the interval between blood tests was too long [41]. In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial bias due to unequal ascertainment of events or differences in non-response or loss to follow-up [42]. Accordingly, we advise that researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for all participants, and that they describe the completeness of ascertainment of variables (see also item 14).\n\nIn case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of their selection has major implications for study validity. In general, controls should reflect the population from which the cases arose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all with advantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from a general population, population roster sampling, random digit dialling, neighbourhood or friend controls are used. Neighbourhood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching on exposure [17]. Controls with other diseases may have advantages over population-based controls, in particular for hospital-based cases, because they better reflect the catchment population of a hospital, have greater comparability of recall and ease of recruitment. However, they can present problems if the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing or being hospitalized for the control condition(s) [43,44]. To remedy this problem often a mixture of the best defensible control diseases is used [45].", "Example 1": "We retrospectively identified patients with a principal diagnosis of myocardial infarction (code 410) according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, from codes designating discharge diagnoses, excluding the codes with a fifth digit of 2, which designates a subsequent episode of care (\u2026) A random sample of the entire Medicare cohort with myocardial infarction from February 1994 to July 1995 was selected (\u2026) To be eligible, patients had to present to the hospital after at least 30 minutes but less than 12 hours of chest pain and had to have ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm on two contiguous leads on the initial electrocardiogram", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 8, "EQ_number": 4.06, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 7, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers.

In multivariable models, authors sometimes use \u2018dependent variable' for an outcome and \u2018independent variable' or \u2018explanatory variable' for exposure and confounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does not distinguish exposures from confounders.\n\nIf many variables have been measured and included in exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, consider providing a list with details on each variable in an appendix, additional table or separate publication. Of note, the International Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new section with \u2018cohort profiles', that includes detailed information on what was measured at different points in time in particular studies [56,57]. Finally, we advise that authors declare all \u2018candidate variables' considered for statistical analysis, rather than selectively reporting only those included in the final models (see also item 16a) [58,59]", "Example 1": "Only major congenital malformations were included in the analyses.

Measurement error and misclassification of exposures or outcomes can make it more difficult to detect cause-effect relationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error in measurement of potential confounders can increase the risk of residual confounding [62,63]. It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of the reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity analyses (see items 12e and 17).\n\nIn addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected. This may be important for laboratory examinations (as in the second example) and other situations. For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve; solutions such as randomising the order of interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may also arise if the compared groups are not given the same diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the same kind than another (see also item 9).", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 10, "EQ_number": 4.04, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 9, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Bias", "RG Checklist text": "Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias", "text_long": "Biased studies produce results that differ systematically from the truth (see also Box 3). It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example [64]. Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example [65]. Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible \u201cdrift\u201d in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.\n\nUnfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles [66]. A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in three psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias [67]. A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 11, "EQ_number": 4.045, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Sample size calculation", "display_number": 10, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Study size", "RG Checklist text": "Explain how the study size was arrived at", "text_long": "A study should be large enough to obtain a point estimate with a sufficiently narrow confidence interval to meaningfully answer a research question.

Small studies often provide valuable information, but wide confidence intervals may indicate that they contribute less to current knowledge in comparison with studies providing estimates with narrower confidence intervals. Also, small studies that show \u2018interesting' or \u2018statistically significant' associations are published more frequently than small studies that do not have \u2018significant' findings. While these studies may provide an early signal in the context of discovery, readers should be informed of their potential weaknesses.\n\nThe importance of sample size determination in observational studies depends on the context. If an analysis is performed on data that were already available for other purposes, the main question is whether the analysis of the data will produce results with sufficient statistical precision to contribute substantially to the literature, and sample size considerations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculation of sample size may be useful when planning a new study. Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty than implied by the single number that is generally produced. For example, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or other assumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise, if not guesswork. The precision obtained in the final analysis can often not be determined beforehand because it will be reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multivariable analyses, the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured, and the exclusion of some individuals.\n\nFew epidemiological studies explain or report deliberations about sample size. We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the considerations that determined the study size (e.g., a fixed available sample, as in the first example above). If the observational study was stopped early when statistical significance was achieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers with post hoc justifications for study size or retrospective power calculations. From the point of view of the reader, confidence intervals indicate the statistical precision that was ultimately obtained. It should be realized that confidence intervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncertainty that may be present in a study (see item 20).", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 12, "EQ_number": 4.062, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "Analysis of quantitative variables", "display_number": 11, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Quantitative variables", "RG Checklist text": "Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses.

For example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable. Grouping choices may have important consequences for later analyses. We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of model fitting.\n\nInvestigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome. Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest.\n\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied quantitative exposure variables. In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only two reported checking for linearity. In another survey, of the psychological literature, dichotomization was justified in only 22 of 110 articles (20%)", "Example 1": "Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8 are considered to be seriously injured.

Regardless, investigators should pre-determine analyses at least for the primary study objectives in a study protocol. Often additional analyses are needed, either instead of, or as well as, those originally envisaged, and these may sometimes be motivated by the data. When a study is reported, authors should tell readers whether particular analyses were suggested by data inspection. Even though the distinction between pre-specified and exploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authors should clarify reasons for particular analyses.\n\nIf groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possible confounding variables by stratification or by multivariable regression (see Box 5) [94]. Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohort studies [95]. whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies [96,97]. Analysts should fully describe specific procedures for variable selection and not only present results from the final model [98,99]. If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a final model, this process should be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or two covariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparent confounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses such as imputation procedures, data transformation, and calculations of attributable risks should also be described. Non-standard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statistical software used reported. As a guiding principle, we advise statistical methods be described \u201cwith enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results\u201d [100].\n\nIn an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated how continuous and multi-category variables were entered into the statistical model [101]. Another study found that among 67 articles in which statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders, it was mostly unclear how confounders were chosen", "Example 1": "The adjusted relative risk was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel technique, when evaluating if confounding by age or gender was present in the groups compared.

Subgroup analyses are nevertheless often done [4]. Readers need to know which subgroup analyses were planned in advance, and which arose while analysing the data. Also, it is important to explain what methods were used to examine whether effects or associations differed across groups (see item 17).\n\nInteraction relates to the situation when one factor modifies the effect of another (therefore also called \u2018effect modification'). The joint action of two factors can be characterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of risk differences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relative risk (see Box 8). Many authors and readers may have their own preference about the way interactions should be analysed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent the joint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses absolute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinical decision making [105]. Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above [103]. A lay-out presenting separate effects of both exposures as well as their joint effect, each relative to no exposure, might be most informative. It is presented in the example for interaction under item 17, and the calculations on the different scales are explained in Box 8", "Example 1": "Sex differences in susceptibility to the 3 lifestyle-related risk factors studied were explored by testing for biological interaction according to Rothman: a new composite variable with 4 categories (a\u2212b\u2212, a\u2212b+, a+b\u2212, and a+b+) was redefined for sex and a dichotomous exposure of interest where a\u2212 and b\u2212 denote absence of exposure. RR was calculated for each category after adjustment for age. An interaction effect is defined as departure from additivity of absolute effects, and excess RR caused by interaction (RERI) was calculated:\n[calculation]\nwhere RR(a+b+) denotes RR among those exposed to both factors where RR(a\u2212b\u2212) is used as reference category (RR = 1.0).

Questionnaires posted to study participants are not always filled in completely, participants may not attend all follow-up visits and routine data sources and clinical databases are often incomplete. Despite its ubiquity and importance, few papers report in detail on the problem of missing data [5,107]. Investigators may use any of several approaches to address missing data. We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in Box 6. We advise that authors report the number of missing values for each variable of interest (exposures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in the analysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values if possible, and indicate how many individuals were excluded because of missing data when describing the flow of participants through the study (see also item 13). For analyses that account for missing data, authors should describe the nature of the analysis (e.g., multiple imputation) and the assumptions that were made (e.g., missing at random, see Box 6).", "Example 1": "Our missing data analysis procedures used missing at random (MAR) assumptions. We used the MICE (multivariate imputation by chained equations) method of multiple multivariate imputation in STATA.

Sampling may be more complex than taking a simple random sample, however. It may include several stages and clustering of participants (e.g., in districts or villages). Proportionate stratification may ensure that subgroups with a specific characteristic are correctly represented. Disproportionate stratification may be useful to over-sample a subgroup of particular interest.\n\nAn estimate of association derived from a complex sample may be more or less precise than that derived from a simple random sample. Measures of precision such as standard error or confidence interval should be corrected using the design effect, a ratio measure that describes how much precision is gained or lost if a more complex sampling strategy is used instead of simple random sampling [119]. Most complex sampling techniques lead to a decrease of precision, resulting in a design effect greater than 1.\n\nWe advise that authors clearly state the method used to adjust for complex sampling strategies so that readers may understand how the chosen sampling method influenced the precision of the obtained estimates. For instance, with clustered sampling, the implicit trade-off between easier data collection and loss of precision is transparent if the design effect is reported. In the example, the calculated design effects of 1.9 for men indicates that the actual sample size would need to be 1.9 times greater than with simple random sampling for the resulting estimates to have equal precision", "Example 1": "The standard errors (SE) were calculated using the Taylor expansion method to estimate the sampling errors of estimators based on the complex sample design.

Issues that may be examined include the criteria for inclusion in analyses, the definitions of exposures or outcomes [122], which confounding variables merit adjustment, the handling of missing data [120,123], possible selection bias or bias from inaccurate or inconsistent measurement of exposure, disease and other variables, and specific analysis choices, such as the treatment of quantitative variables (see item 11). Sophisticated methods are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several biases or assumptions [124\u2013126].\n\nIn 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers [127]. This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power lines [128]. More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or information bias required to distort an association. One important, perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are present", "Example 1": "Because we had a relatively higher proportion of \u2018missing' dead patients with insufficient data (38/148=25.7%) as compared to live patients (15/437=3.4%) (\u2026), it is possible that this might have biased the results. We have, therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We have assumed that the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in the study group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4% for live patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios: either all the exposed missing patients used second generation pills or they all used third-generation pills", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 18, "EQ_number": 5.011, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant numbers and flow", "display_number": "13a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "Results", "RG checklist heading 2": "Participants", "RG Checklist text": "Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study\u2014eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed.

Those included in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied. This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused [130]. These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such response bias (see Box 3) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies [131,132], was explained by differential participation of young women in case and control groups. Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than those with unhealthy children [133]. Although low participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study, transparent information on participation and reasons for non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated such proportions [134].\n\nIdeally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants, from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of participants' data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study, this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and control groups [135]. Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods [136].\n\nA recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies (59%) [137]. Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and non-participation in epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the literature [4,5]. Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades [137,138], which underscores the need for transparent reporting", "Example 1": "Of the 105 freestanding bars and taverns sampled, 13 establishments were no longer in business and 9 were located in restaurants, leaving 83 eligible businesses.

The 25 participating bars and taverns employed 124 bartenders, with 67 bartenders working at least 1 weekly daytime shift.

We advise authors to summarize continuous variables for each study group by giving the mean and standard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetrical distribution, as is often the case, the median and percentile range (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make up a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be presented as continuous variables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions for each category (see also Box 4). In studies that compare groups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should be given by group, as in the example above.\n\nInferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important.\n\nIn cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential confounders. Authors could present this information in a table with columns for participants in two or more exposure categories, which permits to judge the differences in confounders between these categories.\n\nIn case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control persons represent the source population and will usually be different from the cases in many respects. For example, in a study of oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample of young women with infarction more often had risk factors for that disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and a positive family history, than the control group [146]. This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guided by the presence of these risk factors\u2014e.g., because the risk factors were only established after the event (see also Box 5). In case-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed and non-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as is done in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the source population of the cases: if the control group is large enough and represents the source population, exposed and unexposed controls can be compared for potential confounders [121,147]", "Example 1": "Characteristics of the Study Base at Enrolment, Castellana G (Italy), 1985\u20131986\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040297.t002", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 22, "EQ_number": 5.013, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant characteristics", "display_number": "14b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Descriptive data", "RG Checklist text": "Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest\n", "text_long": "As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also item 12c and Box 6).

If the risk of an event changes over follow-up time, present the numbers and rates of events in appropriate intervals of follow-up or as a Kaplan-Meier life table or plot. It might be preferable to show plots as cumulative incidence that go up from 0% rather than down from 100%, especially if the event rate is lower than, say, 30% [153]. Consider presenting such information separately for participants in different exposure categories of interest.

For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing values in covariates (see also item 12c). Estimates should be given with confidence intervals.\n\nReaders can compare unadjusted measures of association with those adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what direction, they changed. Readers may think that \u2018adjusted' results equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see Box 5). Thus, great care should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in the statistical model (see also item 20) [157,158].\n\nAuthors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models. Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations.

Details of the categories used may aid comparison of studies and meta-analysis. If data were grouped using conventional cut-points, such as body mass index thresholds [162], group boundaries (i.e., range of values) can be derived easily, except for the highest and lowest categories. If quantile-derived categories are used, the category boundaries cannot be inferred from the data. As a minimum, authors should report the category boundaries; it is helpful also to report the range of the data and the mean or median values within categories.", "Example 1": "Table.

Relative measures capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confounding [164,165]. Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially between these countries [166,167]. In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio [168].\n\nWidely used statistical models, including logistic [169] and proportional hazards (Cox) regression [170] are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI, see item 12b and Box 8), can be estimated in models based on ratio measures.\n\nIn many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years [163]. Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship between a risk factor and disease (also see Box 7) [171]. Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used [172].\n\nA recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohort studies [173]. A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31 [174].", "Example 1": "10 years' use of HRT [hormone replacement therapy] is estimated to result in five (95% CI 3\u20137) additional breast cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-only preparations and 19 (15\u201323) additional cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-progestagen combinations", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 27, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": 17, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Other analyses", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "In addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specific subgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, the calculation of attributable risks, or use alternative definitions of study variables in sensitivity analyses.\n\nThere is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in general [4,104]. In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specific associations, or effect-measure modification, when overall results appear to suggest little or no effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploring whether an overall association appears consistent across several, preferably pre-specified subgroups especially when a study is large enough to have sufficient data in each subgroup. A second area of debate is about interesting subgroups that arose during the data analysis. They might be important findings, but might also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possible nor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analyses done as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent the early exciting findings stand the test of time [9]. We advise authors to report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4, 12b and 20). This will allow readers to judge the implications of multiplicity, taking into account the study's position on the continuum from discovery to verification or refutation.\n\nA third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also item 12b and Box 8)? A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect\u2014if possible in a table, as in the first example above [183], or in the study by Martinelli et al. [185]. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in Box 8). Confidence intervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an association differs across subgroups.\n\nSensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate the robustness of the findings to missing data or possible biases (see also item 12b). Judgement is needed regarding the level of reporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses were performed, it may be impractical to present detailed findings for them all. It may sometimes be sufficient to report that sensitivity analyses were carried out and that they were consistent with the main results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriate if the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimates vary considerably [59,186].\n\nPocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. The majority claimed differences across groups but only eight articles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see item 12b) [4].", "Example 1": "Table.

It is important not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the relative importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias (see also item 9 and Box 3).\n\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item 8). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as \u2018attenuation' [201,202], or more recently as \u2018regression dilution bias' [203]. However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with them can be biased towards or away from unity [204\u2013206].\n\nWhen discussing limitations, authors may compare the study being presented with other studies in the literature in terms of validity, generalisability and precision. In this approach, each study can be viewed as contribution to the literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and action [207]. Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A survey of authors who had published original research articles in The Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study were reported by the investigators in the survey questionnaires, but not in the published article", "Example 1": "Since the prevalence of counseling increases with increasing levels of obesity, our estimates may overestimate the true prevalence. Telephone surveys also may overestimate the true prevalence of counseling. Although persons without telephones have similar levels of overweight as persons with telephones, persons without telephones tend to be less educated, a factor associated with lower levels of counseling in our study. Also, of concern is the potential bias caused by those who refused to participate as well as those who refused to respond to questions about weight. Furthermore, because data were collected cross-sectionally, we cannot infer that counseling preceded a patient's attempt to lose weight", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 30, "EQ_number": 6.03, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Interpretation", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 20, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Interpretation", "RG Checklist text": "Give a cautious overall interpretation considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.", "text_long": "The heart of the discussion section is the interpretation of a study's results. Over-interpretation is common and human: even when we try hard to give an objective assessment, reviewers often rightly point out that we went too far in some respects. When interpreting results, authors should consider the nature of the study on the discovery to verification continuum and potential sources of bias, including loss to follow-up and non-participation (see also items 9, 12 and 19). Due consideration should be given to confounding (item 16a), the results of relevant sensitivity analyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroup analyses (item 17). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise measurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with many health outcomes and often differs between groups being compared. Variables used to measure SES (income, education, or occupation) are surrogates for other undefined and unmeasured exposures, and the true confounder will by definition be measured with error [208]. Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statistical uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals. The latter do not take into account other uncertainties that arise from a study's design, implementation, and methods of measurement [209].\n\nTo guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may find criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965 helpful [164]. How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association consistently observed in different studies and settings? Is there supporting evidence from experimental studies, including laboratory and animal studies? How specific is the exposure's putative effect, and is there a dose-response relationship? Is the association biologically plausible? These criteria should not, however, be applied mechanically. For example, some have argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should be ignored [210,211]. This is a reversal of the point by Cornfield et al. about the strength of large relative risks (see item 12b) [127]. Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious. For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhood leukaemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because it concerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for which no alternative explanations are obvious [212]. Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating 2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, since dietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestyle factors as well as SES [213]. In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic findings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives was greatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in a randomised cross-over trial [214]. A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important for studies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authors should put their results in context with similar studies and explain how the new study affects the existing body of evidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review.", "Example 1": "Any explanation for an association between death from myocardial infarction and use of second generation oral contraceptives must be conjectural. There is no published evidence to suggest a direct biologic mechanism, and there are no other epidemiologic studies with relevant results. (\u2026) The increase in absolute risk is very small and probably applies predominantly to smokers. Due to the lack of corroborative evidence, and because the analysis is based on relatively small numbers, more evidence on the subject is needed. We would not recommend any change in prescribing practice on the strength of these results", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 31, "EQ_number": 6.04, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Application", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 21, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STROBE cross-sectional", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Generalisability", "RG Checklist text": "Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results", "text_long": "Generalisability, also called external validity or applicability, is the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to other circumstances [216].

Can results be applied to an individual, groups or populations that differ from those enrolled in the study with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, severity of disease, and co-morbid conditions? Are the nature and level of exposures comparable, and the definitions of outcomes relevant to another setting or population? Are data that were collected in longitudinal studies many years ago still relevant today? Are results from health services research in one country applicable to health systems in other countries?\n\nThe question of whether the results of a study have external validity is often a matter of judgment that depends on the study setting, the characteristics of the participants, the exposures examined, and the outcomes assessed. Thus, it is crucial that authors provide readers with adequate information about the setting and locations, eligibility criteria, the exposures and how they were measured, the definition of outcomes, and the period of recruitment and follow-up. The degree of non-participation and the proportion of unexposed participants in whom the outcome develops are also relevant. Knowledge of the absolute risk and prevalence of the exposure, which will often vary across populations, are helpful when applying results to other settings and populations (see Box 7)", "Example 1": "How applicable are our estimates to other HIV-1-infected patients? This is an important question because the accuracy of prognostic models tends to be lower when applied to data other than those used to develop them.

Structured abstracts provide readers with a series of headings pertaining to the purpose, conduct, findings, and conclusions of the systematic review being reported [26],[27]. They give readers more complete information and facilitate finding information more easily than unstructured abstracts [28],[29],[30],[31],[32].\n\nA highly structured abstract of a systematic review could include the following headings: Context (or Background); Objective (or Purpose); Data Sources; Study Selection (or Eligibility Criteria); Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods (or Data Extraction and Data Synthesis); Results; Limitations; and Conclusions (or Implications). Alternatively, a simpler structure could cover but collapse some of the above headings (e.g., label Study Selection and Study Appraisal as Review Methods) or omit some headings such as Background and Limitations.\n\nIn the highly structured abstract mentioned above, authors use the Background heading to set the context for readers and explain the importance of the review question. Under the Objectives heading, they ideally use elements of PICOS (see Box 2) to state the primary objective of the review. Under a Data Sources heading, they summarize sources that were searched, any language or publication type restrictions, and the start and end dates of searches. Study Selection statements then ideally describe who selected studies using what inclusion criteria. Data Extraction Methods statements describe appraisal methods during data abstraction and the methods used to integrate or summarize the data. The Data Synthesis section is where the main results of the review are reported. If the review includes meta-analyses, authors should provide numerical results with confidence intervals for the most important outcomes. Ideally, they should specify the amount of evidence in these analyses (numbers of studies and numbers of participants). Under a Limitations heading, authors might describe the most important weaknesses of included studies as well as limitations of the review process. Then authors should provide clear and balanced Conclusions that are closely linked to the objective and findings of the review.

Consequently, many local \ngovernments have enacted or are considering policies that mandate increased \n\nphysical activity in schools, although the effect of such interventions on body \ncomposition has not been assessed", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 4, "EQ_number": 3.02, "EQ heading 1": "Introduction", "EQ heading 2": "Objectives", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 4, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Objectives", "RG Checklist text": "Provide an explicit statement of questions being addressed with reference to participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS).", "text_long": "The questions being addressed, and the rationale for them, are one of the most critical parts of a systematic review. They should be stated precisely and explicitly so that readers can understand quickly the review's scope and the potential applicability of the review to their interests [35]. Framing questions so that they include the following five \u201cPICOS\u201d components may improve the explicitness of review questions: (1) the patient population or disease being addressed (P), (2) the interventions or exposure of interest (I), (3) the comparators (C), (4) the main outcome or endpoint of interest (O), and (5) the study designs chosen (S). For more detail regarding PICOS, see Box 2.\n\nGood review questions may be narrowly focused or broad, depending on the overall objectives of the review. Sometimes broad questions might increase the applicability of the results and facilitate detection of bias, exploratory analyses, and sensitivity analyses [35],[36]. Whether narrowly focused or broad, precisely stated review objectives are critical as they help define other components of the review process such as the eligibility criteria (Item 6) and the search for relevant literature (Items 7 and 8)", "Example 1": "To examine whether topical or intraluminal antibiotics reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection, we reviewed randomized, controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of these antibiotics for primary prophylaxis against catheter-related bloodstream infection and mortality compared with no antibiotic therapy in adults undergoing hemodialysis", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 5, "EQ_number": 7.03, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "", "EQ heading 3": "Link to protocol and/or study register", "display_number": 5, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Methods", "RG checklist heading 2": "Protocol and registration", "RG Checklist text": "Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it can be accessed (e.g., Web address) and, if available, provide registration information including the registration number.", "text_long": "A protocol is important because it pre-specifies the objectives and methods of the systematic review. For instance, a protocol specifies outcomes of primary interest, how reviewers will extract information about those outcomes, and methods that reviewers might use to quantitatively summarize the outcome data (see Item 13). Having a protocol can help restrict the likelihood of biased post hoc decisions in review methods, such as selective outcome reporting. Several sources provide guidance about elements to include in the protocol for a systematic review [16],[38],[39]. For meta-analyses of individual patient-level data, we advise authors to describe whether a protocol was explicitly designed and whether, when, and how participating collaborators endorsed it [40],[41].\n\nAuthors may modify protocols during the research, and readers should not automatically consider such modifications inappropriate. For example, legitimate modifications may extend the period of searches to include older or newer studies, broaden eligibility criteria that proved too narrow, or add analyses if the primary analyses suggest that additional ones are warranted. Authors should, however, describe the modifications and explain their rationale.\n\nAlthough worthwhile protocol amendments are common, one must consider the effects that protocol modifications may have on the results of a systematic review, especially if the primary outcome is changed. Bias from selective outcome reporting in randomized trials has been well documented [42],[43]. An examination of 47 Cochrane reviews revealed indirect evidence for possible selective reporting bias for systematic reviews. Almost all (n\u200a=\u200a43) contained a major change, such as the addition or deletion of outcomes, between the protocol and the full publication [44]. Whether (or to what extent) the changes reflected bias, however, was not clear. For example, it has been rather common not to describe outcomes that were not presented in any of the included studies.\n\nRegistration of a systematic review, typically with a protocol and registration number, is not yet common, but some opportunities exist [45],[46]. Registration may possibly reduce the risk of multiple reviews addressing the same question [45],[46],[47],[48], reduce publication bias, and provide greater transparency when updating systematic reviews. Of note, a survey of systematic reviews indexed in MEDLINE in November 2004 found that reports of protocol use had increased to about 46% [3] from 8% noted in previous surveys [49]. The improvement was due mostly to Cochrane reviews, which, by requirement, have a published protocol [3].", "Example 1": "Methods of the analysis and inclusion criteria were specified in advance and documented in a protocol.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 6, "EQ_number": 4.031, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Participants", "EQ heading 3": "Description and matching", "display_number": 6, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Eligibility criteria", "RG Checklist text": "Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g., years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rational", "text_long": "Knowledge of the eligibility criteria is essential in appraising the validity, applicability, and comprehensiveness of a review. Thus, authors should unambiguously specify eligibility criteria used in the review. Carefully defined eligibility criteria inform various steps of the review methodology. They influence the development of the search strategy and serve to ensure that studies are selected in a systematic and unbiased manner.\n\nA study may be described in multiple reports, and one report may describe multiple studies. Therefore, we separate eligibility criteria into the following two components: study characteristics and report characteristics. Both need to be reported. Study eligibility criteria are likely to include the populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study designs of interest (PICOS; see Box 2), as well as other study-specific elements, such as specifying a minimum length of follow-up. Authors should state whether studies will be excluded because they do not include (or report) specific outcomes to help readers ascertain whether the systematic review may be biased as a consequence of selective reporting [42],[43].\n\nReport eligibility criteria are likely to include language of publication, publication status (e.g., inclusion of unpublished material and abstracts), and year of publication. Inclusion or not of non-English language literature [51],[52],[53],[54],[55], unpublished data, or older data can influence the effect estimates in meta-analyses [56],[57],[58],[59].

Thus, we advise authors to report their full electronic search strategy for at least one major database. As an alternative to presenting search strategies for all databases, authors could indicate how the search took into account other databases searched, as index terms vary across databases. If different searches are used for different parts of a wider question (e.g., questions relating to benefits and questions relating to harms), we recommend authors provide at least one example of a strategy for each part of the objective [69].

Most searches have constraints, for example relating to limited time or financial resources, inaccessible or inadequately indexed reports and databases, unavailability of experts with particular language or database searching skills, or review questions for which pertinent evidence is not easy to find. Authors should be straightforward in describing their search constraints.

We also advise using the PRISMA flow diagram to summarize study selection processes (see Item 17; Box 3).\n\nEfforts to enhance objectivity and avoid mistakes in study selection are important. Thus authors should report whether each stage was carried out by one or several people, who these people were, and, whenever multiple independent investigators performed the selection, what the process was for resolving disagreements. The use of at least two investigators may reduce the possibility of rejecting relevant reports [75]. The benefit may be greatest for topics where selection or rejection of an article requires difficult judgments [76].

They might also contact authors of included studies for information that has not been, or is unclearly, reported. In meta-analysis of individual patient data, this phase involves collection and scrutiny of detailed raw databases. The authors should describe these methods, including any steps taken to reduce bias and mistakes during data collection and data extraction [78] (Box 3).\n\nSome systematic reviewers use a data extraction form that could be reported as an appendix or \u201cWeb extra\u201d to their report. These forms could show the reader what information reviewers sought (see Item 11) and how they extracted it. Authors could tell readers if the form was piloted. Regardless, we advise authors to tell readers who extracted what data, whether any extractions were completed in duplicate, and, if so, whether duplicate abstraction was done independently and how disagreements were resolved.\n\nPublished reports of the included studies may not provide all the information required for the review. Reviewers should describe any actions they took to seek additional information from the original researchers (see Item 7). The description might include how they attempted to contact researchers, what they asked for, and their success in obtaining the necessary information. Authors should also tell readers when individual patient data were sought from the original researchers [41] (see Item 11) and indicate the studies for which such data were used in the analyses. The reviewers ideally should also state whether they confirmed the accuracy of the information included in their review with the original researchers, for example, by sending them a copy of the draft review [79].\n\nSome studies are published more than once. Duplicate publications may be difficult to ascertain, and their inclusion may introduce bias [80],[81]. We advise authors to describe any steps they used to avoid double counting and piece together data from multiple reports of the same study (e.g., juxtaposing author names, treatment comparisons, sample sizes, or outcomes). We also advise authors to indicate whether all reports on a study were considered, as inconsistencies may reveal important limitations. For example, a review of multiple publications of drug trials showed that reported study characteristics may differ from report to report, including the description of the design, number of patients analyzed, chosen significance level, and outcomes [82]. Authors ideally should present any algorithm that they used to select data from overlapping reports and any efforts they used to solve logical inconsistencies across reports", "Example 1": "We developed a data extraction sheet (based on the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's data extraction template), pilot-tested it on ten randomly-selected included studies, and refined it accordingly.

If the review is limited to reporting only those variables that were obtained, rather than those that were deemed important but could not be obtained, bias might be introduced and the reader might be misled. It is therefore helpful if authors can refer readers to the protocol (see Item 5), and archive their extraction forms (see Item 10), including definitions of variables. The published systematic review should include a description of the processes used with, if relevant, specification of how readers can get access to additional materials.\n\nWe encourage authors to report whether some variables were added after the review started. Such variables might include those found in the studies that the reviewers identified (e.g., important outcome measures that the reviewers initially overlooked). Authors should describe the reasons for adding any variables to those already pre-specified in the protocol so that readers can understand the review process.\n\nWe advise authors to report any assumptions they made about missing or unclear information and to explain those processes. For example, in studies of women aged 50 or older it is reasonable to assume that none were pregnant, even if this is not reported. Likewise, review authors might make assumptions about the route of administration of drugs assessed. However, special care should be taken in making assumptions about qualitative information. For example, the upper age limit for \u201cchildren\u201d can vary from 15 years to 21 years, \u201cintense\u201d physiotherapy might mean very different things to different researchers at different times and for different patients, and the volume of blood associated with \u201cheavy\u201d blood loss might vary widely depending on the setting.", "Example 1": "Information was extracted from each included trial on: (1) characteristics of trial participants (including age, stage and severity of disease, and method of diagnosis), and the trial's inclusion and exclusion criteria; (2) type of intervention (including type, dose, duration and frequency of the NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]; versus placebo or versus the type, dose, duration and frequency of another NSAID; or versus another pain management drug; or versus no treatment); (3) type of outcome measure (including the level of pain reduction, improvement in quality of life score (using a validated scale), effect on daily activities, absence from work or school, length of follow up, unintended effects of treatment, number of women requiring more invasive treatment)", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 12, "EQ_number": 4.04, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 12, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Risk of bias in individual studies", "RG Checklist text": "Describe methods used for assessing risk of bias in individual studies (including specification of whether this was done at the study or outcome level, or both), and how this information is to be used in any data synthesis.", "text_long": "The likelihood that the treatment effect reported in a systematic review approximates the truth depends on the validity of the included studies, as certain methodological characteristics may be associated with effect sizes [87],[88]. For example, trials without reported adequate allocation concealment exaggerate treatment effects on average compared to those with adequate concealment [88]. Therefore, it is important for authors to describe any methods that they used to gauge the risk of bias in the included studies and how that information was used [89]. Additionally, authors should provide a rationale if no assessment of risk of bias was undertaken. The most popular term to describe the issues relevant to this item is \u201cquality,\u201d but for the reasons that are elaborated in Box 4 we prefer to name this item as \u201cassessment of risk of bias.\u201d\n\nMany methods exist to assess the overall risk of bias in included studies, including scales, checklists, and individual components [90],[91]. As discussed in Box 4, scales that numerically summarize multiple components into a single number are misleading and unhelpful [92],[93]. Rather, authors should specify the methodological components that they assessed. Common markers of validity for randomized trials include the following: appropriate generation of random allocation sequence [94]; concealment of the allocation sequence [93]; blinding of participants, health care providers, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators [95],[96],[97],[98]; proportion of patients lost to follow-up [99],[100]; stopping of trials early for benefit [101]; and whether the analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle [100],[102]. The ultimate decision regarding which methodological features to evaluate requires consideration of the strength of the empiric data, theoretical rationale, and the unique circumstances of the included studies.\n\nAuthors should report how they assessed risk of bias; whether it was in a blind manner; and if assessments were completed by more than one person, and if so, whether they were completed independently [103],[104]. Similarly, we encourage authors to report any calibration exercises among review team members that were done. Finally, authors need to report how their assessments of risk of bias are used subsequently in the data synthesis (see Item 16). Despite the often difficult task of assessing the risk of bias in included studies, authors are sometimes silent on what they did with the resultant assessments [89]. If authors exclude studies from the review or any subsequent analyses on the basis of the risk of bias, they should tell readers which studies they excluded and explain the reasons for those exclusions (see Item 6). Authors should also describe any planned sensitivity or subgroup analyses related to bias assessments (see Item 16).", "Example 1": "To ascertain the validity of eligible randomized trials, pairs of reviewers working independently and with adequate reliability determined the adequacy of randomization and concealment of allocation, blinding of patients, health care providers, data collectors, and outcome assessors; and extent of loss to follow-up (i.e. proportion of patients in whom the investigators were not able to ascertain outcomes).", "Example 2": "To explore variability in study results (heterogeneity) we specified the following hypotheses before conducting the analysis. We hypothesised that effect size may differ according to the methodological quality of the studies.", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 13, "EQ_number": 4.071, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "", "EQ heading 3": "Outcome measures", "display_number": 13, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Summary measures", "RG Checklist text": "State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means).", "text_long": "When planning a systematic review, it is generally desirable that authors pre-specify the outcomes of primary interest (see Item 5) as well as the intended summary effect measure for each outcome. The chosen summary effect measure may differ from that used in some of the included studies. If possible the choice of effect measures should be explained, though it is not always easy to judge in advance which measure is the most appropriate.\n\nFor binary outcomes, the most common summary measures are the risk ratio, odds ratio, and risk difference [108]. Relative effects are more consistent across studies than absolute effects [109],[110], although absolute differences are important when interpreting findings (see Item 24).\n\nFor continuous outcomes, the natural effect measure is the difference in means [108]. Its use is appropriate when outcome measurements in all studies are made on the same scale. The standardized difference in means is used when the studies do not yield directly comparable data. Usually this occurs when all studies assess the same outcome but measure it in a variety of ways (e.g., different scales to measure depression).\n\nFor time-to-event outcomes, the hazard ratio is the most common summary measure. Reviewers need the log hazard ratio and its standard error for a study to be included in a meta-analysis [111]. This information may not be given for all studies, but methods are available for estimating the desired quantities from other reported information [111]. Risk ratio and odds ratio (in relation to events occurring by a fixed time) are not equivalent to the hazard ratio, and median survival times are not a reliable basis for meta-analysis [112]. If authors have used these measures they should describe their methods in the report.", "Example 1": "Relative risk of mortality reduction was the primary measure of treatment effect.

Although such data handling may facilitate meta-analyses, it is sometimes needed even when meta-analyses are not done. For example, in trials with more than two intervention groups it may be necessary to combine results for two or more groups (e.g., receiving similar but non-identical interventions), or it may be desirable to include only a subset of the data to match the review's inclusion criteria. When several different scales (e.g., for depression) are used across studies, the sign of some scores may need to be reversed to ensure that all scales are aligned (e.g., so low values represent good health on all scales). Standard deviations may have to be reconstructed from other statistics such as p-values and t statistics [115],[116], or occasionally they may be imputed from the standard deviations observed in other studies [117]. Time-to-event data also usually need careful conversions to a consistent format [111]. Authors should report details of any such data processing.\n\nStatistical combination of data from two or more separate studies in a meta-analysis may be neither necessary nor desirable (see Box 5 and Item 21). Regardless of the decision to combine individual study results, authors should report how they planned to evaluate between-study variability (heterogeneity or inconsistency) (Box 6). The consistency of results across trials may influence the decision of whether to combine trial results in a meta-analysis.\n\nWhen meta-analysis is done, authors should specify the effect measure (e.g., relative risk or mean difference) (see Item 13), the statistical method (e.g., inverse variance), and whether a fixed- or random-effects approach, or some other method (e.g., Bayesian) was used (see Box 6). If possible, authors should explain the reasons for those choices.", "Example 1": "We tested for heterogeneity with the Breslow-Day test, and used the method proposed by Higgins et al. to measure inconsistency (the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity) of effects across lipid-lowering interventions. The advantages of this measure of inconsistency (termed I2) are that it does not inherently depend on the number of studies and is accompanied by an uncertainty interval.", "Example 2": "In very few instances, estimates of baseline mean or mean QOL [Quality of life] responses were obtained without corresponding estimates of variance (standard deviation [SD] or standard error). In these instances, an SD was imputed from the mean of the known SDs. In a number of cases, the response data available were the mean and variance in a pre study condition and after therapy. The within-patient variance in these cases could not be calculated directly and was approximated by assuming independence.", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 15, "EQ_number": 4.04, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 15, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Risk of bias across studies", "RG Checklist text": "Specify any assessment of risk of bias that may affect the cumulative evidence (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting within studies).", "text_long": "Reviewers should explore the possibility that the available data are biased. They may examine results from the available studies for clues that suggest there may be missing studies (publication bias) or missing data from the included studies (selective reporting bias) (see Box 7). Authors should report in detail any methods used to investigate possible bias across studies.\n\nIt is difficult to assess whether within-study selective reporting is present in a systematic review. If a protocol of an individual study is available, the outcomes in the protocol and the published report can be compared. Even in the absence of a protocol, outcomes listed in the methods section of the published report can be compared with those for which results are presented [120]. In only half of 196 trial reports describing comparisons of two drugs in arthritis were all the effect variables in the methods and results sections the same [82]. In other cases, knowledge of the clinical area may suggest that it is likely that the outcome was measured even if it was not reported. For example, in a particular disease, if one of two linked outcomes is reported but the other is not, then one should question whether the latter has been selectively omitted [121],[122].\n\nOnly 36% (76 of 212) of therapeutic systematic reviews published in November 2004 reported that study publication bias was considered, and only a quarter of those intended to carry out a formal assessment for that bias [3]. Of 60 meta-analyses in 24 articles published in 2005 in which formal assessments were reported, most were based on fewer than ten studies; most displayed statistically significant heterogeneity; and many reviewers misinterpreted the results of the tests employed [123]. A review of trials of antidepressants found that meta-analysis of only the published trials gave effect estimates 32% larger on average than when all trials sent to the drug agency were analyzed [67].", "Example 1": "For each trial we plotted the effect by the inverse of its standard error. The symmetry of such \u2018funnel plots\u2019 was assessed both visually, and formally with Egger's test, to see if the effect decreased with increasing sample size.", "Example 2": "We assessed the possibility of publication bias by evaluating a funnel plot of the trial mean differences for asymmetry, which can result from the non publication of small trials with negative results\u2026Because graphical evaluation can be subjective, we also conducted an adjusted rank correlation test and a regression asymmetry test as formal statistical tests for publication bias\u2026We acknowledge that other factors, such as differences in trial quality or true study heterogeneity, could produce asymmetry in funnel plots.", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 16, "EQ_number": 4.046, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Statistical methods", "display_number": 16, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Additional analyses", "RG Checklist text": "Describe methods of additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression), if done, indicating which were pre-specified.", "text_long": "Authors may perform additional analyses to help understand whether the results of their review are robust, all of which should be reported. Such analyses include sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression [125].\n\nSensitivity analyses are used to explore the degree to which the main findings of a systematic review are affected by changes in its methods or in the data used from individual studies (e.g., study inclusion criteria, results of risk of bias assessment). Subgroup analyses address whether the summary effects vary in relation to specific (usually clinical) characteristics of the included studies or their participants. Meta-regression extends the idea of subgroup analysis to the examination of the quantitative influence of study characteristics on the effect size [126]. Meta-regression also allows authors to examine the contribution of different variables to the heterogeneity in study findings. Readers of systematic reviews should be aware that meta-regression has many limitations, including a danger of over-interpretation of findings [127],[128].\n\nEven with limited data, many additional analyses can be undertaken. The choice of which analysis to undertake will depend on the aims of the review. None of these analyses, however, are exempt from producing potentially misleading results. It is important to inform readers whether these analyses were performed, their rationale, and which were pre-specified.", "Example 1": "Sensitivity analyses were pre-specified.

It is useful if authors delineate for readers the number of selected articles that were identified from the different sources so that they can see, for example, whether most articles were identified through electronic bibliographic sources or from references or experts. Literature identified primarily from references or experts may be prone to citation or publication bias [131],[132].\n\nThe flow diagram and text should describe clearly the process of report selection throughout the review. Authors should report: unique records identified in searches; records excluded after preliminary screening (e.g., screening of titles and abstracts); reports retrieved for detailed evaluation; potentially eligible reports that were not retrievable; retrieved reports that did not meet inclusion criteria and the primary reasons for exclusion; and the studies included in the review. Indeed, the most appropriate layout may vary for different reviews.\n\nAuthors should also note the presence of duplicate or supplementary reports so that readers understand the number of individual studies compared to the number of reports that were included in the review. Authors should be consistent in their use of terms, such as whether they are reporting on counts of citations, records, publications, or studies. We believe that reporting the number of studies is the most important.\n\nA flow diagram can be very useful; it should depict all the studies included based upon fulfilling the eligibility criteria, whether or not data have been combined for statistical analysis. A recent review of 87 systematic reviews found that about half included a QUOROM flow diagram [133]. The authors of this research recommended some important ways that reviewers can improve the use of a flow diagram when describing the flow of information throughout the review process, including a separate flow diagram for each important outcome reported [133].", "Example 1": "In text: A total of 10 studies involving 13 trials were identified for inclusion in the review.

Such information includes PICOS (Box 2) and specific information relevant to the review question. For example, if the review is examining the long-term effects of antidepressants for moderate depressive disorder, authors should report the follow-up periods of the included studies. For each included study, authors should provide a citation for the source of their information regardless of whether or not the study is published. This information makes it easier for interested readers to retrieve the relevant publications or documents.\n\nReporting study-level data also allows the comparison of the main characteristics of the studies included in the review. Authors should present enough detail to allow readers to make their own judgments about the relevance of included studies. Such information also makes it possible for readers to conduct their own subgroup analyses and interpret subgroups, based on study characteristics.\n\nAuthors should avoid, whenever possible, assuming information when it is missing from a study report (e.g., sample size, method of randomization). Reviewers may contact the original investigators to try to obtain missing information or confirm the data extracted for the systematic review. If this information is not obtained, this should be noted in the report. If information is imputed, the reader should be told how this was done and for which items. Presenting study-level data makes it possible to clearly identify unpublished information obtained from the original researchers and make it available for the public record.\n\nTypically, study-level characteristics are presented as a table as in the example in Table 2. Such presentation ensures that all pertinent items are addressed and that missing or unclear information is clearly indicated. Although paper-based journals do not generally allow for the quantity of information available in electronic journals or Cochrane reviews, this should not be accepted as an excuse for omission of important aspects of the methods or results of included studies, since these can, if necessary, be shown on a Web site.\n\nFollowing the presentation and description of each included study, as discussed above, reviewers usually provide a narrative summary of the studies. Such a summary provides readers with an overview of the included studies. It may for example address the languages of the published papers, years of publication, and geographic origins of the included studies.\n\nThe PICOS framework is often helpful in reporting the narrative summary indicating, for example, the clinical characteristics and disease severity of the participants and the main features of the intervention and of the comparison group. For non-pharmacological interventions, it may be helpful to specify for each study the key elements of the intervention received by each group. Full details of the interventions in included studies were reported in only three of 25 systematic reviews relevant to general practice [84].", "Example 1": "In text:\nCharacteristics of included studies\nMethods: All four studies finally selected for the review were randomised controlled trials published in English. The duration of the intervention was 24 months for the RIO-North America and 12 months for the RIO-Diabetes, RIO-Lipids and RIO-Europe study. Although the last two described a period of 24 months during which they were conducted, only the first 12-months results are provided. All trials had a run-in, as a single blind period before the randomisation.\nParticipants: The included studies involved 6625 participants. The main inclusion criteria entailed adults (18 years or older), with a body mass index greater than 27 kg/m2 and less than 5 kg variation in body weight within the three months before study entry.\nIntervention: All trials were multicentric. The RIO-North America was conducted in the USA and Canada, RIO-Europe in Europe and the USA, RIO-Diabetes in the USA and 10 other different countries not specified, and RIO-Lipids in eight unspecified different countries.\nThe intervention received was placebo, 5 mg of rimonabant or 20 mg of rimonabant once daily in addition to a mild hypocaloric diet (600 kcal/day deficit).\nOutcomes: \nPrimary: In all studies the primary outcome assessed was weight change from baseline after one year of treatment and the RIO-North America study also evaluated the prevention of weight regain between the first and second year. All studies evaluated adverse effects, including those of any kind and serious events. Quality of life was measured in only one study, but the results were not described (RIO-Europe).\nSecondary and additional outcomes: These included prevalence of metabolic syndrome after one year and change in cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood pressure, lipid profile, etc.\nNo study included mortality and costs as outcome.\nThe timing of outcome measures was variable and could include monthly investigations, evaluations every three months or a single final evaluation after one year.", "Example 2": "In table:\nExample Table: Summary of included studies evaluating the efficacy of antiemetic agents in acute gastroenteritis.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100.t002", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 19, "EQ_number": 5.01, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Data", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 19, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Risk of bias within studies", "RG Checklist text": "Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome-level assessment (see Item 12).", "text_long": "We recommend that reviewers assess the risk of bias in the included studies using a standard approach with defined criteria (see Item 12). They should report the results of any such assessments [89].\n\nReporting only summary data (e.g., \u201ctwo of eight trials adequately concealed allocation\u201d) is inadequate because it fails to inform readers which studies had the particular methodological shortcoming. A more informative approach is to explicitly report the methodological features evaluated for each study. The Cochrane Collaboration's new tool for assessing the risk of bias also requests that authors substantiate these assessments with any relevant text from the original studies [11]. It is often easiest to provide these data in a tabular format, as in the example. However, a narrative summary describing the tabular data can also be helpful for readers.", "Example 1": "In table:\nExample Table: Quality measures of the randomized controlled trials that failed to fulfill any one of six markers of validity.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000100.t003", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 20, "EQ_number": 5.01, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Data", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 20, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Results of individual studies", "RG Checklist text": "For all outcomes considered (benefits and harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group and (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals, ideally with a forest plot.", "text_long": "Publication of summary data from individual studies allows the analyses to be reproduced and other analyses and graphical displays to be investigated. Others may wish to assess the impact of excluding particular studies or consider subgroup analyses not reported by the review authors. Displaying the results of each treatment group in included studies also enables inspection of individual study features. For example, if only odds ratios are provided, readers cannot assess the variation in event rates across the studies, making the odds ratio impossible to interpret [138]. Additionally, because data extraction errors in meta-analyses are common and can be large [139], the presentation of the results from individual studies makes it easier to identify errors. For continuous outcomes, readers may wish to examine the consistency of standard deviations across studies, for example, to be reassured that standard deviation and standard error have not been confused [138].\n\nFor each study, the summary data for each intervention group are generally given for binary outcomes as frequencies with and without the event (or as proportions such as 12/45). It is not sufficient to report event rates per intervention group as percentages. The required summary data for continuous outcomes are the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for each group. In reviews that examine time-to-event data, the authors should report the log hazard ratio and its standard error (or confidence interval) for each included study. Sometimes, essential data are missing from the reports of the included studies and cannot be calculated from other data but may need to be imputed by the reviewers. For example, the standard deviation may be imputed using the typical standard deviations in the other trials [116],[117] (see Item 14). Whenever relevant, authors should indicate which results were not reported directly and had to be estimated from other information (see Item 13). In addition, the inclusion of unpublished data should be noted.\n\nFor all included studies it is important to present the estimated effect with a confidence interval. This information may be incorporated in a table showing study characteristics or may be shown in a forest plot [140]. The key elements of the forest plot are the effect estimates and confidence intervals for each study shown graphically, but it is preferable also to include, for each study, the numerical group-specific summary data, the effect size and confidence interval, and the percentage weight (see second example [Figure 3]). For discussion of the results of meta-analysis, see Item 21.\n\nIn principle, all the above information should be provided for every outcome considered in the review, including both benefits and harms. When there are too many outcomes for full information to be included, results for the most important outcomes should be included in the main report with other information provided as a Web appendix. The choice of the information to present should be justified in light of what was originally stated in the protocol. Authors should explicitly mention if the planned main outcomes cannot be presented due to lack of information. There is some evidence that information on harms is only rarely reported in systematic reviews, even when it is available in the original studies [141]. Selective omission of harms results biases a systematic review and decreases its ability to contribute to informed decision making.", "Example 1": "In figure:\nExample Figure: Overall failure (defined as failure of assigned regimen or relapse) with tetracycline-rifampicin versus tetracycline-streptomycin.\nCI, confidence interval.

Initial narrative descriptions of the evidence covered in the review (see Item 18) may tell readers important things about the study populations and the design and conduct of studies. These descriptions can facilitate the examination of patterns across studies. They may also provide important information about applicability of evidence, suggest the likely effects of any major biases, and allow consideration, in a systematic manner, of multiple explanations for possible differences of findings across studies.\n\nIf authors have conducted one or more meta-analyses, they should present the results as an estimated effect across studies with a confidence interval. It is often simplest to show each meta-analysis summary with the actual results of included studies in a forest plot (see Item 20) [140]. It should always be clear which of the included studies contributed to each meta-analysis. Authors should also provide, for each meta-analysis, a measure of the consistency of the results from the included studies such as I2 (heterogeneity; see Box 6); a confidence interval may also be given for this measure [145]. If no meta-analysis was performed, the qualitative inferences should be presented as systematically as possible with an explanation of why meta-analysis was not done, as in the second example above [143]. Readers may find a forest plot, without a summary estimate, helpful in such cases.\n\nAuthors should in general report syntheses for all the outcome measures they set out to investigate (i.e., those described in the protocol; see Item 4) to allow readers to draw their own conclusions about the implications of the results.

Authors should tell readers if the planned meta-analysis was not thought appropriate or possible for some of the outcomes and the reasons for that decision.\n\nIt may not always be sensible to give meta-analysis results and forest plots for each outcome.

Because the reviewed studies did not explicitly address patients with rapid clinical deterioration who may need acute intervention, our conclusions do not apply to this important subset of patients.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 25, "EQ_number": 6.02, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Limitations and strengths", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 25, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Limitations", "RG Checklist text": "Discuss limitations at study and outcome level (e.g., risk of bias), and at review level (e.g., incomplete retrieval of identified research, reporting bias).", "text_long": "A discussion of limitations should address the validity (i.e., risk of bias) and reporting (informativeness) of the included studies, limitations of the review process, and generalizability (applicability) of the review. Readers may find it helpful if authors discuss whether studies were threatened by serious risks of bias, whether the estimates of the effect of the intervention are too imprecise, or if there were missing data for many participants or important outcomes.\n\nLimitations of the review process might include limitations of the search (e.g., restricting to English-language publications), and any difficulties in the study selection, appraisal, and meta-analysis processes. For example, poor or incomplete reporting of study designs, patient populations, and interventions may hamper interpretation and synthesis of the included studies [84]. Applicability of the review may be affected if there are limited data for certain populations or subgroups where the intervention might perform differently or few studies assessing the most important outcomes of interest; or if there is a substantial amount of data relating to an outdated intervention or comparator or heavy reliance on imputation of missing values for summary estimates (Item 14).", "Example 1": "Outcome level:\nThe meta-analysis reported here combines data across studies in order to estimate treatment effects with more precision than is possible in a single study. The main limitation of this meta-analysis, as with any overview, is that the patient population, the antibiotic regimen and the outcome definitions are not the same across studies.\n\nStudy and review level:\nOur study has several limitations. The quality of the studies varied. Randomization was adequate in all trials; however, 7 of the articles did not explicitly state that analysis of data adhered to the intention-to-treat principle, which could lead to overestimation of treatment effect in these trials, and we could not assess the quality of 4 of the 5 trials reported as abstracts. Analyses did not identify an association between components of quality and re-bleeding risk, and the effect size in favour of combination therapy remained statistically significant when we excluded trials that were reported as abstracts.\n\nPublication bias might account for some of the effect we observed. Smaller trials are, in general, analyzed with less methodological rigor than larger studies, and an asymmetrical funnel plot suggests that selective reporting may have led to an overestimation of effect sizes in small trials.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 26, "EQ_number": 6.05, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Implications for research", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 26, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "", "RG checklist heading 2": "Conclusions", "RG Checklist text": "Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of other evidence, and implications for future research.", "text_long": "Systematic reviewers sometimes draw conclusions that are too optimistic [157] or do not consider the harms equally as carefully as the benefits, although some evidence suggests these problems are decreasing [158]. If conclusions cannot be drawn because there are too few reliable studies, or too much uncertainty, this should be stated. Such a finding can be as important as finding consistent effects from several large studies.\n\nAuthors should try to relate the results of the review to other evidence, as this helps readers to better interpret the results. For example, there may be other systematic reviews about the same general topic that have used different methods or have addressed related but slightly different questions [159],[160]. Similarly, there may be additional information relevant to decision makers, such as the cost-effectiveness of the intervention (e.g., health technology assessment). Authors may discuss the results of their review in the context of existing evidence regarding other interventions.\n\nWe advise authors also to make explicit recommendations for future research. In a sample of 2,535 Cochrane reviews, 82% included recommendations for research with specific interventions, 30% suggested the appropriate type of participants, and 52% suggested outcome measures for future research [161]. There is no corresponding assessment about systematic reviews published in medical journals, but we believe that such recommendations are much less common in those reviews.\n\nClinical research should not be planned without a thorough knowledge of similar, existing research [162]. There is evidence that this still does not occur as it should and that authors of primary studies do not consider a systematic review when they design their studies [163]. We believe systematic reviews have great potential for guiding future clinical research.", "Example 1": "Implications for practice:\nBetween 1995 and 1997 five different meta-analyses of the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on infection and mortality were published. All confirmed a significant reduction in infections, though the magnitude of the effect varied from one review to another. The estimated impact on overall mortality was less evident and has generated considerable controversy on the cost effectiveness of the treatment. Only one among the five available reviews, however, suggested that a weak association between respiratory tract infections and mortality exists and lack of sufficient statistical power may have accounted for the limited effect on mortality.\n\nImplications for research:\nA logical next step for future trials would thus be the comparison of this protocol against a regimen of a systemic antibiotic agent only to see whether the topical component can be dropped. We have already identified six such trials but the total number of patients so far enrolled (n\u200a=\u200a1056) is too small for us to be confident that the two treatments are really equally effective. If the hypothesis is therefore considered worth testing more and larger randomised controlled trials are warranted. Trials of this kind, however, would not resolve the relevant issue of treatment induced resistance. To produce a satisfactory answer to this, studies with a different design would be necessary. Though a detailed discussion goes beyond the scope of this paper, studies in which the intensive care unit rather than the individual patient is the unit of randomisation and in which the occurrence of antibiotic resistance is monitored over a long period of time should be undertaken.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 27, "EQ_number": 7.02, "EQ heading 1": "Other information", "EQ heading 2": "Funding and conflict of interest", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 27, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "PRISMA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Funding", "RG checklist heading 2": "Funding", "RG Checklist text": "Describe sources of funding or other support (e.g., supply of data) for the systematic review; role of funders for the systematic review.", "text_long": "Authors of systematic reviews, like those of any other research study, should disclose any funding they received to carry out the review, or state if the review was not funded.

For example, authors should indicate that the study was a cohort study, which followed people over a particular time period, and describe the group of persons that comprised the cohort and their exposure status. Similarly, if the investigation used a case-control design, the cases and controls and their source population should be described. If the study was a cross-sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned. When a study is a variant of the three main study types, there is an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the example above [28].\n\nWe recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study \u2018prospective' or \u2018retrospective' because these terms are ill defined [29]. One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case-control studies [30]. A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study was developed [31]. A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases were selected [32]. Some advise against using these terms [33], or adopting the alternatives \u2018concurrent' and \u2018historical' for describing cohort studies [34]. In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as concurrent and historical. We recommend that, whenever authors use these words, they define what they mean. Most importantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how and when data collection took place.\n\nThe first part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from a study. If a new report is in line with the original aims of the study, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlier publication and by briefly restating the salient features of the study. However, the aims of a study may also evolve over time. Researchers often use data for purposes for which they were not originally intended, including, for example, official vital statistics that were collected primarily for administrative purposes, items in questionnaires that originally were only included for completeness, or blood samples that were collected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and carotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutation in the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not of myocardial infarction or stroke [35]. The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important.

Knowing when a study took place and over what period participants were recruited and followed up places the study in historical context and is important for the interpretation of results.\n\nInformation about setting includes recruitment sites or sources (e.g., electoral roll, outpatient clinic, cancer registry, or tertiary care centre). Information about location may refer to the countries, towns, hospitals or practices where the investigation took place. We advise stating dates rather than only describing the length of time periods. There may be different sets of dates for exposure, disease occurrence, recruitment, beginning and end of follow-up, and data collection.

", "text_long": "Detailed descriptions of the study participants help readers understand the applicability of the results. Investigators usually restrict a study population by defining clinical, demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants. Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis and comorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibility criteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey of observational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did not specify eligibility criteria [5].\n\nEligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not always necessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to report all eligibility criteria and also to describe the group from which the study population was selected (e.g., the general population of a region or country), and the method of recruitment (e.g., referral or self-selection through advertisements).\n\nKnowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized non-response and loss to follow-up and whether the procedures were similar for all participants, informs judgments about the validity of results. For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detect acute infections, readers needed to know the interval between blood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judge whether some infections likely were missed because the interval between blood tests was too long [41]. In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial bias due to unequal ascertainment of events or differences in non-response or loss to follow-up [42]. Accordingly, we advise that researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for all participants, and that they describe the completeness of ascertainment of variables (see also item 14).\n\nIn case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of their selection has major implications for study validity. In general, controls should reflect the population from which the cases arose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all with advantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from a general population, population roster sampling, random digit dialling, neighbourhood or friend controls are used. Neighbourhood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching on exposure [17]. Controls with other diseases may have advantages over population-based controls, in particular for hospital-based cases, because they better reflect the catchment population of a hospital, have greater comparability of recall and ease of recruitment. However, they can present problems if the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing or being hospitalized for the control condition(s) [43,44]. To remedy this problem often a mixture of the best defensible control diseases is used [45].", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 8, "EQ_number": 4.031, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Participants", "EQ heading 3": "Description and matching", "display_number": "6b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Eligibility criteria", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Cohort study \u2013 For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed.\nCase-control study \u2013 For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number of controls per case.\n", "text_long": "Matching is much more common in case-control studies, but occasionally, investigators use matching in cohort studies to make groups comparable at the start of follow-up. Matching in cohort studies makes groups directly comparable for potential confounders and presents fewer intricacies than with case-control studies. For example, it is not necessary to take the matching into account for the estimation of the relative risk [48]. Because matching in cohort studies may increase statistical precision investigators might allow for the matching in their analyses and thus obtain narrower confidence intervals.\n\nIn case-control studies matching is done to increase a study's efficiency by ensuring similarity in the distribution of variables between cases and controls, in particular the distribution of potential confounding variables [48,49]. Because matching can be done in various ways, with one or more controls per case, the rationale for the choice of matching variables and the details of the method used should be described. Commonly used forms of matching are frequency matching (also called group matching) and individual matching. In frequency matching, investigators choose controls so that the distribution of matching variables becomes identical or similar to that of cases. Individual matching involves matching one or several controls to each case. Although intuitively appealing and sometimes useful, matching in case-control studies has a number of disadvantages, is not always appropriate, and needs to be taken into account in the analysis", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 9, "EQ_number": 4.06, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "7a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Variables", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers.

This applies to criteria for cases in a case-control study, disease events during follow-up in a cohort study and prevalent disease in a cross-sectional study. Clear definitions and steps taken to adhere to them are particularly important for any disease condition of primary interest in the study.\n\nFor some studies, \u2018determinant' or \u2018predictor' may be appropriate terms for exposure variables and outcomes may be called \u2018endpoints'. In multivariable models, authors sometimes use \u2018dependent variable' for an outcome and \u2018independent variable' or \u2018explanatory variable' for exposure and confounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does not distinguish exposures from confounders.\n\nIf many variables have been measured and included in exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, consider providing a list with details on each variable in an appendix, additional table or separate publication. Of note, the International Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new section with \u2018cohort profiles', that includes detailed information on what was measured at different points in time in particular studies [56,57]. Finally, we advise that authors declare all \u2018candidate variables' considered for statistical analysis, rather than selectively reporting only those included in the final models (see also item 16a) [58,59]", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 10, "EQ_number": 4.06, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "7b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Variables", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Clearly define genetic exposures (genetic variants) using a widely-used nomenclature system.

Measurement error and misclassification of exposures or outcomes can make it more difficult to detect cause-effect relationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error in measurement of potential confounders can increase the risk of residual confounding [62,63]. It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the findings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of the reference standard that was used. Rather than simply citing validation studies (as in the first example), we advise that authors give the estimated validity or reliability, which can then be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivity analyses (see items 12e and 17).\n\nIn addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected. This may be important for laboratory examinations (as in the second example) and other situations. For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve; solutions such as randomising the order of interviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias may also arise if the compared groups are not given the same diagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of the same kind than another (see also item 9).", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 12, "EQ_number": 4.061, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "Data measurement", "display_number": "8b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Data sources/measurement", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Describe laboratory methods, including source and storage of DNA, genotyping methods and platforms (including the allele calling algorithm used, and its version), error rates and call rates.

It is important for a reader to know what measures were taken during the conduct of a study to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigators carefully consider potential sources of bias when they plan their study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend that authors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Specifically, the direction and magnitude of bias should be discussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may be reduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in the first example [64]. Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example [65]. Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the additional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investigators have set up quality control programs for data collection to counter a possible \u201cdrift\u201d in measurements of variables in longitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described.\n\nUnfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-control and cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that investigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history of cancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5 articles [66]. A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in three psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias [67]. A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potential selection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35 (71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias may have affected results", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 14, "EQ_number": 4.04, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "9b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Bias", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias", "text_long": "For quantitative outcome variables, specify if any investigation of potential bias resulting from pharmacotherapy was undertaken.

Large samples are needed to distinguish a small association from no association. Small studies often provide valuable information, but wide confidence intervals may indicate that they contribute less to current knowledge in comparison with studies providing estimates with narrower confidence intervals. Also, small studies that show \u2018interesting' or \u2018statistically significant' associations are published more frequently than small studies that do not have \u2018significant' findings. While these studies may provide an early signal in the context of discovery, readers should be informed of their potential weaknesses.\n\nThe importance of sample size determination in observational studies depends on the context. If an analysis is performed on data that were already available for other purposes, the main question is whether the analysis of the data will produce results with sufficient statistical precision to contribute substantially to the literature, and sample size considerations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculation of sample size may be useful when planning a new study. Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty than implied by the single number that is generally produced. For example, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or other assumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise, if not guesswork. The precision obtained in the final analysis can often not be determined beforehand because it will be reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multivariable analyses, the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured, and the exclusion of some individuals.\n\nFew epidemiological studies explain or report deliberations about sample size. We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the considerations that determined the study size (e.g., a fixed available sample, as in the first example above). If the observational study was stopped early when statistical significance was achieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers with post hoc justifications for study size or retrospective power calculations. From the point of view of the reader, confidence intervals indicate the statistical precision that was ultimately obtained. It should be realized that confidence intervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncertainty that may be present in a study (see item 20).", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 16, "EQ_number": 4.062, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Variables", "EQ heading 3": "Analysis of quantitative variables", "display_number": 11, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Quantitative variables", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses.

For example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable. Grouping choices may have important consequences for later analyses. We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of model fitting.\n\nInvestigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome. Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest.\n\nIn a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied quantitative exposure variables. In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only two reported checking for linearity.

When a study is reported, authors should tell readers whether particular analyses were suggested by data inspection. Even though the distinction between pre-specified and exploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authors should clarify reasons for particular analyses.\n\nIf groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possible confounding variables by stratification or by multivariable regression (see Box 5) [94]. Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohort studies [95]. whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies [96,97]. Analysts should fully describe specific procedures for variable selection and not only present results from the final model [98,99]. If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a final model, this process should be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or two covariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparent confounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses such as imputation procedures, data transformation, and calculations of attributable risks should also be described. Non-standard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statistical software used reported. As a guiding principle, we advise statistical methods be described \u201cwith enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results\u201d [100].\n\nIn an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated how continuous and multi-category variables were entered into the statistical model [101]. Another study found that among 67 articles in which statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders, it was mostly unclear how confounders were chosen", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 18, "EQ_number": 4.046, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Statistical methods", "display_number": "12b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Statistical methods", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions\n\n", "text_long": "As discussed in detail under item 17, many debate the use and value of analyses restricted to subgroups of the study population [4,104]. Subgroup analyses are nevertheless often done [4]. Readers need to know which subgroup analyses were planned in advance, and which arose while analysing the data. Also, it is important to explain what methods were used to examine whether effects or associations differed across groups (see item 17).\n\nInteraction relates to the situation when one factor modifies the effect of another (therefore also called \u2018effect modification'). The joint action of two factors can be characterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of risk differences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relative risk (see Box 8). Many authors and readers may have their own preference about the way interactions should be analysed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent the joint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses absolute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinical decision making [105]. Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above [103]. A lay-out presenting separate effects of both exposures as well as their joint effect, each relative to no exposure, might be most informative.

Questionnaires posted to study participants are not always filled in completely, participants may not attend all follow-up visits and routine data sources and clinical databases are often incomplete. Despite its ubiquity and importance, few papers report in detail on the problem of missing data [5,107]. Investigators may use any of several approaches to address missing data. We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in Box 6. We advise that authors report the number of missing values for each variable of interest (exposures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in the analysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values if possible, and indicate how many individuals were excluded because of missing data when describing the flow of participants through the study (see also item 13). For analyses that account for missing data, authors should describe the nature of the analysis (e.g., multiple imputation) and the assumptions that were made (e.g., missing at random, see Box 6).", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 20, "EQ_number": 4.046, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Statistical methods", "display_number": "12d", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Statistical methods", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed", "text_long": "Cohort studies are analysed using life table methods or other approaches that are based on the person-time of follow-up and time to developing the disease of interest. Among individuals who remain free of the disease at the end of their observation period, the amount of follow-up time is assumed to be unrelated to the probability of developing the outcome. This will be the case if follow-up ends on a fixed date or at a particular age. Loss to follow-up occurs when participants withdraw from a study before that date. This may hamper the validity of a study if loss to follow-up occurs selectively in exposed individuals, or in persons at high risk of developing the disease (\u2018informative censoring'). In the example above, patients lost to follow-up in treatment programmes with no active follow-up had fewer CD4 helper cells than those remaining under observation and were therefore at higher risk of dying [116].\n\nIt is important to distinguish persons who reach the end of the study from those lost to follow-up. Unfortunately, statistical software usually does not distinguish between the two situations: in both cases follow-up time is automatically truncated (\u2018censored') at the end of the observation period. Investigators therefore need to decide, ideally at the stage of planning the study, how they will deal with loss to follow-up. When few patients are lost, investigators may either exclude individuals with incomplete follow-up, or treat them as if they withdrew alive at either the date of loss to follow-up or the end of the study.

Sophisticated methods are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several biases or assumptions [124\u2013126].\n\nIn 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers [127]. This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power lines [128]. More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or information bias required to distort an association. One important, perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are present", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 22, "EQ_number": 4.046, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Statistical methods", "display_number": "12f", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Statistical methods", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "State whether Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was considered and, if so, how.

Those included in a study often differ in relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied. This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused [130]. These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such response bias (see Box 3) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies [131,132], was explained by differential participation of young women in case and control groups. Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than those with unhealthy children [133]. Although low participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study, transparent information on participation and reasons for non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calculated such proportions [134].\n\nIdeally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants, from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of participants' data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study, this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and control groups [135]. Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods [136].\n\nA recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies (59%) [137]. Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and non-participation in epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the literature [4,5]. Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades [137,138], which underscores the need for transparent reporting", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 28, "EQ_number": 5.011, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant numbers and flow", "display_number": "13b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Participants", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Give reasons for non-participation at each stage\n\n", "text_long": "Explaining the reasons why people no longer participated in a study or why they were excluded from statistical analyses helps readers judge whether the study population was representative of the target population and whether bias was possibly introduced.

Information about potential confounders, including whether and how they were measured, influences judgments about study validity. We advise authors to summarize continuous variables for each study group by giving the mean and standard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetrical distribution, as is often the case, the median and percentile range (e.g., 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make up a small number of ordered categories (such as stages of disease I to IV) should not be presented as continuous variables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions for each category (see also Box 4). In studies that compare groups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should be given by group, as in the example above.\n\nInferential measures such as standard errors and confidence intervals should not be used to describe the variability of characteristics, and significance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not an appropriate criterion for selecting which confounders to adjust for in analysis; even small differences in a confounder that has a strong effect on the outcome can be important.\n\nIn cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential confounders. Authors could present this information in a table with columns for participants in two or more exposure categories, which permits to judge the differences in confounders between these categories.\n\nIn case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control persons represent the source population and will usually be different from the cases in many respects. For example, in a study of oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample of young women with infarction more often had risk factors for that disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and a positive family history, than the control group [146]. This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guided by the presence of these risk factors\u2014e.g., because the risk factors were only established after the event (see also Box 5). In case-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed and non-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as is done in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the source population of the cases: if the control group is large enough and represents the source population, exposed and unexposed controls can be compared for potential confounders [121,147].", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 31, "EQ_number": 5.013, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Description", "EQ heading 3": "Participant characteristics", "display_number": "14b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Descriptive data", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest\n", "text_long": "As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also item 12c and Box 6).

For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing values in covariates (see also item 12c). Estimates should be given with confidence intervals.\n\nReaders can compare unadjusted measures of association with those adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what direction, they changed. Readers may think that \u2018adjusted' results equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see Box 5). Thus, great care should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in the statistical model (see also item 20) [157,158].\n\nAuthors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models. Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations. Inappropriate decisions may introduce bias, for example by including variables that are in the causal pathway between exposure and disease (unless the aim is to asses how much of the effect is carried by the intermediary variable). If the decision to include a variable in the model was based on the change in the estimate, it is important to report what change was considered sufficiently important to justify its inclusion.

Relative measures capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confounding [164,165]. Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially between these countries [166,167]. In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio [168].\n\nWidely used statistical models, including logistic [169] and proportional hazards (Cox) regression [170] are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI, see item 12b and Box 8), can be estimated in models based on ratio measures.\n\nIn many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years [163]. Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship between a risk factor and disease (also see Box 7) [171]. Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used [172].\n\nA recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohort studies [173]. A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31 [174].", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 37, "EQ_number": 5.021, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Main estimates", "display_number": "16d", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Main results", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Report results of any adjustments for multiple comparisons", "text_long": "", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 38, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": "17a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Other analyses", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "In addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specific subgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, the calculation of attributable risks, or use alternative definitions of study variables in sensitivity analyses.\n\nThere is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in general [4,104]. In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specific associations, or effect-measure modification, when overall results appear to suggest little or no effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploring whether an overall association appears consistent across several, preferably pre-specified subgroups especially when a study is large enough to have sufficient data in each subgroup. A second area of debate is about interesting subgroups that arose during the data analysis. They might be important findings, but might also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possible nor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analyses done as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent the early exciting findings stand the test of time [9]. We advise authors to report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4, 12b and 20). This will allow readers to judge the implications of multiplicity, taking into account the study's position on the continuum from discovery to verification or refutation.\n\nA third area of debate is how joint effects and interactions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive or multiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by the statistical model that fits best (see also item 12b and Box 8)? A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of each exposure as well as the joint effect\u2014if possible in a table, as in the first example above [183], or in the study by Martinelli et al. [185]. Such a table gives the reader sufficient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in Box 8). Confidence intervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader to judge the strength of the data. In addition, confidence intervals around measures of interaction, such as the Relative Excess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of interaction or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is that authors use comparisons of P-values across subgroups, which lead to erroneous claims about an effect modifier. For instance, a statistically significant association in one category (e.g., men), but not in the other (e.g., women) does not in itself provide evidence of effect modification. Similarly, the confidence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inappropriately used to infer that there is no interaction when intervals overlap. A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an association differs across subgroups.\n\nSensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate the robustness of the findings to missing data or possible biases (see also item 12b). Judgement is needed regarding the level of reporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses were performed, it may be impractical to present detailed findings for them all. It may sometimes be sufficient to report that sensitivity analyses were carried out and that they were consistent with the main results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriate if the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimates vary considerably [59,186].\n\nPocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. The majority claimed differences across groups but only eight articles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see item 12b) [4].", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 39, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": "17b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Other analyses", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "If numerous genetic exposures (genetic variants) were examined, summarize results from all analyses undertaken.", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 40, "EQ_number": 5.024, "EQ heading 1": "Results", "EQ heading 2": "Analysis", "EQ heading 3": "Other analyses", "display_number": "17c", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Other analyses", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Report other analyses done\u2014e.g., analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses", "text_long": "If detailed results are available elsewhere, state how they can be accessed.", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 41, "EQ_number": 6.01, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Key results", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 18, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Key results", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Summarise key results with reference to study objectives", "text_long": "", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 42, "EQ_number": 6.02, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Limitations", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 19, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Limitations", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision.

It is important not only to identify the sources of bias and confounding that could have affected results, but also to discuss the relative importance of different biases, including the likely direction and magnitude of any potential bias (see also item 9 and Box 3).\n\nAuthors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with several aspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and the measurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item 8). The inability to precisely measure true values of an exposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the less precisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. This effect has been described as \u2018attenuation' [201,202], or more recently as \u2018regression dilution bias' [203]. However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with them can be biased towards or away from unity [204\u2013206].\n\nWhen discussing limitations, authors may compare the study being presented with other studies in the literature in terms of validity, generalisability and precision. In this approach, each study can be viewed as contribution to the literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and action [207]. Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A survey of authors who had published original research articles in The Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study were reported by the investigators in the survey questionnaires, but not in the published article", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 43, "EQ_number": 6.03, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Interpretation", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 20, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Interpretation", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Give a cautious overall interpretation considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.", "text_long": "The heart of the discussion section is the interpretation of a study's results. Over-interpretation is common and human: even when we try hard to give an objective assessment, reviewers often rightly point out that we went too far in some respects. When interpreting results, authors should consider the nature of the study on the discovery to verification continuum and potential sources of bias, including loss to follow-up and non-participation (see also items 9, 12 and 19). Due consideration should be given to confounding (item 16a), the results of relevant sensitivity analyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroup analyses (item 17). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecise measurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with many health outcomes and often differs between groups being compared. Variables used to measure SES (income, education, or occupation) are surrogates for other undefined and unmeasured exposures, and the true confounder will by definition be measured with error [208]. Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statistical uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals. The latter do not take into account other uncertainties that arise from a study's design, implementation, and methods of measurement [209].\n\nTo guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may find criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965 helpful [164]. How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association consistently observed in different studies and settings? Is there supporting evidence from experimental studies, including laboratory and animal studies? How specific is the exposure's putative effect, and is there a dose-response relationship? Is the association biologically plausible? These criteria should not, however, be applied mechanically. For example, some have argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should be ignored [210,211]. This is a reversal of the point by Cornfield et al. about the strength of large relative risks (see item 12b) [127]. Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious. For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhood leukaemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because it concerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for which no alternative explanations are obvious [212]. Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating 2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, since dietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestyle factors as well as SES [213]. In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic findings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives was greatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in a randomised cross-over trial [214]. A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important for studies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authors should put their results in context with similar studies and explain how the new study affects the existing body of evidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review.", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 44, "EQ_number": 6.04, "EQ heading 1": "Discussion", "EQ heading 2": "Application", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 21, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Generalisability", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results", "text_long": "Generalisability, also called external validity or applicability, is the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to other circumstances [216].

Can results be applied to an individual, groups or populations that differ from those enrolled in the study with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, severity of disease, and co-morbid conditions? Are the nature and level of exposures comparable, and the definitions of outcomes relevant to another setting or population? Are data that were collected in longitudinal studies many years ago still relevant today? Are results from health services research in one country applicable to health systems in other countries?\n\nThe question of whether the results of a study have external validity is often a matter of judgment that depends on the study setting, the characteristics of the participants, the exposures examined, and the outcomes assessed. Thus, it is crucial that authors provide readers with adequate information about the setting and locations, eligibility criteria, the exposures and how they were measured, the definition of outcomes, and the period of recruitment and follow-up. The degree of non-participation and the proportion of unexposed participants in whom the outcome develops are also relevant. Knowledge of the absolute risk and prevalence of the exposure, which will often vary across populations, are helpful when applying results to other settings and populations (see Box 7)", "Example 1": "", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 45, "EQ_number": 7.02, "EQ heading 1": "Other information", "EQ heading 2": "Funding and conflict of interest", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": 22, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "STREGA", "RG checklist heading 1": "Funding", "RG checklist heading 2": "", "RG Checklist text": "Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based", "text_long": "Some journals require authors to disclose the presence or absence of financial and other conflicts of interest [100,218].

Antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to reduce blood loss in patients with both normal and exaggerated fibrinolytic responses to surgery, and do so without apparently increasing the risk of post-operative complications, . . .\nExisting knowledge: Systemic antifibrinolytic agents are widely used in major surgery to prevent fibrinolysis and thus reduce surgical blood loss. A recent systematic review [reference] of randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytic agents (mainly aprotinin or tranexamic acid) in elective surgical patients identified 89 trials including 8,580 randomised patients (74 trials in cardiac, eight in orthopaedic, four in liver, and three in vascular surgery). The results showed that these treatments reduced the numbers needing transfusion by one third, reduced the volume needed per transfusion by one unit, and halved the need for further surgery to control bleeding. These differences were all highly statistically significant. There was also a statistically non-significant reduction in the risk of death (RR=0.85: 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14) in the antifibrinolytic treated group.\nNeed for a trial: A simple and widely practicable treatment that reduces blood loss following trauma might prevent thousands of premature trauma deaths each year and secondly could reduce exposure to the risks of blood transfusion. Blood is a scarce and expensive resource and major concerns remain about the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. . . . A large randomised trial is therefore needed of the use of a simple, inexpensive, widely practicable antifibrinolytic treatment such as tranexamic acid . . . in a wide range of trauma patients who, when they reach hospital are thought to be at risk of major haemorrhage that could significantly affect their chances of survival.\nDose selection\nThe systematic review of randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytic agents in surgery showed that dose regimens of tranexamic acid vary widely.[reference] . . .\nIn this emergency situation, administration of a fixed dose would be more practicable as determining the weight of a patient would be impossible. Therefore a fixed dose within the dose range which has been shown to inhibit fibrinolysis and provide haemostatic benefit is being used for this trial. . . . The planned duration of administration allows for the full effect of tranexamic acid on the immediate risk of haemorrhage without extending too far into the acute phase response seen after surgery and trauma.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 11, "EQ_number": 3.01, "EQ heading 1": "Introduction", "EQ heading 2": "Background and rationale", "EQ heading 3": "", "display_number": "6b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "SPIRIT", "RG checklist heading 1": "Introduction", "RG checklist heading 2": "Background and rationale: choice of comparators", "RG Checklist text": "Explanation for choice of comparators", "text_long": "The choice of control interventions has important implications for trial ethics, recruitment, results, and interpretation.

Explanation of the clinical relevance of chosen efficacy and harm outcomes is strongly recommended", "text_long": "The trial outcomes are fundamental to study design and interpretation of results. For a given intervention, an outcome can generally reflect efficacy (beneficial effect) or harm (adverse effect). The outcomes of main interest are designated as primary outcomes, which usually appear in the objectives (Item 7) and sample size calculation (Item 14). The remaining outcomes constitute secondary or other outcomes.\n\nFor each outcome, the trial protocol should define four components: the specific measurement variable, which corresponds to the data collected directly from trial participants (eg, Beck Depression Inventory score, all cause mortality); the participant-level analysis metric, which corresponds to the format of the outcome data that will be used from each trial participant for analysis (eg, change from baseline, final value, time to event); the method of aggregation, which refers to the summary measure format for each study group (eg, mean, proportion with score > 2); and the specific measurement time point of interest for analysis.163\n\nIt is also important to explain the rationale for the choice of trial outcomes. An ideal outcome is valid, reproducible, relevant to the target population (eg, patients), and responsive to changes in the health condition being studied.67 The use of a continuous versus dichotomous method of aggregation can affect study power and estimates of treatment effect,164 165 and subjective outcomes are more prone to bias from inadequate blinding (ascertainment bias) and allocation concealment (selection bias) than objective outcomes.166 167 Although composite outcomes increase event rates and statistical power, their relevance and interpretation can be unclear if the individual component outcomes vary greatly in event rates, importance to patients, or amount of missing data.\n\nThe number of primary outcomes should be as small as possible. Although up to 38% of trials define multiple primary outcomes,4 35 163 this practice can introduce problems with multiplicity, selective reporting, and interpretation when there are inconsistent results across outcomes. Problems also arise when trial protocols do not designate any primary outcomes, as seen in half (28/59) of protocols for a sample of trials published from 2002-2008,12 and in 25% of randomised trial protocols that received ethics approval in Denmark in 1994-95.4 Furthermore, major discrepancies in the primary outcomes designated in protocols/registries/regulatory submissions versus final trial publications are common; favour the reporting of statistically significant primary outcomes over non-significant ones; and are often not acknowledged in final publications.172 173 174 175 176 Such bias can only be identified and deterred if trial outcomes are clearly defined beforehand in the protocol and if protocol information is made public.177\n\nWhere possible, the development and adoption of a common set of key trial outcomes within a specialty can help to deter selective reporting of outcomes and to facilitate comparisons and pooling of results across trials in a meta-analysis.178 179 180 The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative aims to facilitate the development and application of such standardised sets of core outcomes for clinical trials of specific conditions (www.comet-initiative.org).

Treatment success is defined as 3 or less significant blisters present on examination at 6 weeks. Significant blisters are defined as intact blisters containing fluid which are at least 5 mm in diameter. However, if the participant has popped a blister, or the blister is at a site that makes it susceptible to bursting such as the sole of the foot, it can be considered part of the blister count, providing there is a flexible (but not dry) roof present over a moist base. Mucosal blisters will be excluded from the count.\nA survey of the UK DCTN [Dermatology Clinical Trials Network] membership showed that a point estimate of 25% inferiority in effectiveness would be acceptable assuming a gain in the safety profile of at least 10%.\n\nThis measure of success was selected as it was considered to be more clinically relevant than a continuous measure of blister count. It would be less clinically relevant to perform an absolute blister count and report a percentage reduction. Instead, to state that treatment is considered a success if remission is achieved (ie the presence of three or less blisters on physical examination at 6 weeks) more closely reflects clinical practice. In addition, it is far less burdensome on investigators than including a full blister count, which would mean counting in the region of 50-60 blisters in many cases. This outcome measure will be performed as a single blind assessment.\n\nDifference between the two treatment arms in the proportion of participants reporting grade 3, 4 and 5 (mortality) adverse events which are possibly, probably or definitely related to BP [bullous pemphigoid] medication in the 52 weeks following randomisation.

If the planned sample size is not derived statistically, then this should be explicitly stated along with a rationale for the intended sample size (eg, exploratory nature of pilot studies; pragmatic considerations for trials in rare diseases).\n\nFor trials that involve a formal sample size calculation, the guiding principle is that the planned sample size should be large enough to have a high probability (power) of detecting a true effect of a given magnitude, should it exist. Sample size calculations are generally based on one primary outcome; however, it may also be worthwhile to plan for adequate study power or report the power that will be available (given the proposed sample size) for other important outcomes or analyses because trials are often underpowered to detect harms or subgroup effects.\n\nAmong randomised trial protocols that describe a sample size calculation, 4-40% do not state all components of the calculation.6 11 The protocol should generally include the following: the outcome (Item 12); the values assumed for the outcome in each study group (eg, proportion with event, or mean and standard deviation) (table 4\u21d3); the statistical test (Item 20a); alpha (type 1 error) level; power; and the calculated sample size per group\u2014both assuming no loss of data and, if relevant, after any inflation for anticipated missing data (Item 20c). Trial investigators are also encouraged to provide a rationale or reference for the outcome values assumed for each study group.187 The values of certain prespecified variables tend to be inappropriately inflated (eg, clinically important treatment effect size)188 189 or underestimated (eg, standard deviation for continuous outcomes),190 leading to trials having less power in the end than what was originally calculated. Finally, when uncertainty of a sample size estimate is acknowledged, methods exist for re-estimating sample size.191 The intended use of such an adaptive design approach should be stated in the protocol.\n\nFor designs and frameworks other than parallel group superiority trials, additional elements are required in the sample size calculation. For example, an estimate of the standard deviation of within-person changes from baseline should be included for crossover trials192; the intracluster correlation coefficient for cluster randomised trials193; and the equivalence or non-inferiority margin for equivalence or non-inferiority trials respectively.108 194 Such elements are often not described in final trial reports,110 195 196 197 198 and it is unclear how often they are specified in the protocol.\n\nComplete description of sample size calculations in the protocol enables an assessment of whether the trial will be adequately powered to detect a clinically important difference. It also promotes transparency and discourages inappropriate post hoc revision that is intended to support a favourable interpretation of results or portray consistency between planned and achieved sample sizes.", "Example 1": "The sample size was calculated on the basis of the primary hypothesis. In the exploratory study,[reference] those referred to PEPS [psychoeducation with problem solving] had a greater improvement in social functioning at 6 month follow-up equivalent to 1.05 points on the SFQ [Social Functioning Questionnaire]. However, a number of people received PEPS who were not included in the trial (eg, the wait-list control) and, for this larger sample (N=93), the mean pre-post- treatment difference was 1.79 (pre-treatment mean=13.85, SD=4.21; post-treatment mean=12.06, SD=4.21). (Note: a lower SFQ score is more desirable). This difference of almost 2 points accords with other evidence that this is a clinically significant and important difference.[reference] A reduction of 2 points or more on the SFQ at 1 year follow-up in an RCT of cognitive behaviour therapy in health anxiety was associated with a halving of secondary care appointments (1.24.vs 0.65), a clinically significant reduction in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS[reference]) Anxiety score of 2.5 (9.9 vs 7.45) and a reduction in health anxiety (the main outcome) of 5.6 points (17.8 vs 12.2) (11 is a normal population score and 18 is pathological).[reference] These findings suggest that improvements in social functioning may accrue over 1 year, hence we expect to find a greater magnitude of response at the 72 week follow-up than we did in the exploratory trial. Therefore, we have powered this trial to be able to detect a difference in SFQ score of 2 points. SFQ standard deviations vary between treatment, control, and the wait-list samples, ranging from 3.78 to 4.53. We have based our sample size estimate on the most conservative (ie, largest) SD [standard deviation]. To detect a mean difference in SFQ score of 2 point (SD = 4.53) at 72 weeks with a two-sided significance level of 1% and power of 80% with equal allocation to two arms would require 120 patients in each arm of the trial.

It can be expected that including covariates of prognostic importance in the logistic regression model as defined for the confirmatory analysis will increase the power as compared to the chi-square test. As the individual results for the primary endpoint are available within 30 days after surgery, the drop-out rate is expected to be small. Nevertheless, a potential dilution of the treatment effect due to drop-outs is taken into account (eg no photographs available, loss to follow up); it is assumed that this can be compensated by additional 5% of patients to be randomized, and therefore the total sample size required for a fixed sample size design amounts to n=712+38=750 patients...\n\nAn adaptive interim analysis [reference] will be performed after availability of the results for the primary endpoint for a total of 375 randomized patients (ie, 50% of the number of patients required in a fixed sample size design). The following type I error rates and decision boundaries for the interim and the final analysis are specified:\n\n \u2022 Overall one-sided type I error rate: 0.025\n \u2022 Boundary for the one-sided p-value of the first stage for accepting the null-hypothesis within the interim analysis: \u03b10=0.5\n \u2022 One-sided local type I error rate for testing the null-hypothesis within the interim analysis: \u03b11=0.0102\n \u2022 Boundary for the product of the one-sided p-values of both stages for the rejection of the null-hypothesis in the final analysis: c\u03b1=0.0038\nIf the trial will be continued with a second stage after the interim analysis (this is possible if for the one-sided p-value p1 of the interim analysis p1\u2208]0.0102,0.5[ [ie 0.5\u2265P1\u22650.0102] holds true, the results of the interim analysis can be taken into account for a recalculation of the required sample size. If the sample size recalculation leads to the conclusion that more than 1200 patients are required, the study is stopped, because the related treatment group difference is judged to be of minor clinical importance...\n\nThe actually achieved sample size is then not fixed but random, and a variety of scenarios can be considered. If the sample size is calculated under the same assumptions with respect to the SSI rates for the two groups, applying the same the overall significance level of \u03b1=0.025 (one-sided) but employing additionally the defined stopping boundaries and recalculating the sample size for the second stage at a conditional power of 80% on the basis of the SSI rates observed in the interim analysis results in an average total sample size of n=766 patients; the overall power of the study is then 90% (ADDPLAN\u00ae, version 5.0)\n", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 23, "EQ_number": 4.033, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Participants", "EQ heading 3": "Communication and recruitment", "display_number": 15, "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "SPIRIT", "RG checklist heading 1": "Methods: Participants, interventions, and outcomes", "RG checklist heading 2": "Recruitment", "RG Checklist text": "Strategies for achieving adequate participant enrolment to reach target sample size", "text_long": "The main goal of recruitment is to meet the target sample size (Item 14).

Allocation concealment helps to ensure that a participant\u2019s decision to provide informed consent, or a recruiter\u2019s decision to enrol a participant, is not influenced by knowledge of the group to which they will be allocated if they join the trial.242 Allocation concealment should not be confused with blinding (masking) (Item 17) \n\nWithout adequate allocation concealment, even random, unpredictable assignment sequences can be subverted.233 241 For example, a common practice is to enclose assignments in sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. However, if the envelopes are not opaque and contents are visible when held up to a light source, or if the envelopes can be unsealed and resealed, then this method of allocation concealment can be corrupted.\n\nProtocols should describe the planned allocation concealment mechanism in sufficient detail to enable assessment of its adequacy.

Blinding of data monitoring committees is generally discouraged.254 255\n\nWhen blinding of trial participants and care providers is not possible because of obvious differences between the interventions,256 257 blinding of the outcome assessors can often still be implemented.17 It may also be possible to blind participants or trial personnel to the study hypothesis in terms of which intervention is considered active. For example, in a trial evaluating light therapy for depression, participants were informed that the study involved testing two different forms of light therapy, whereas the true hypothesis was that bright blue light was considered potentially effective and that dim red light was considered placebo.258\n\nDespite its importance, blinding is often poorly described in trial protocols.3 The protocol should explicitly state who will be blinded to intervention groups\u2014at a minimum, the blinding status of trial participants, care providers, and outcome assessors. Such a description is much preferred over the use of ambiguous terminology such as \u201csingle blind\u201d or \u201cdouble blind.\u201d259 260 Protocols should also describe the comparability of blinded interventions (Item 11a)150\u2014for example, similarities in appearance, use of specific flavours to mask a distinctive taste\u2014and the timing of final unblinding of all trial participants (eg, after the creation of a locked analysis data set).3\n\nFurthermore, any strategies to reduce the potential for unblinding should be described in the protocol, such as pre-trial testing of blinding procedures.261 The use of a fixed code (versus a unique code for each participant) to denote each study group assignment (eg, A=Group 1; B=Group 2) can be problematic, as the unblinding of one participant will result in the inadvertent loss of blinding for all trial participants.\n\nSome have suggested that the success of blinding be formally tested by asking key trial persons to guess the study group assignment and comparing these responses to what would be expected by chance.262 However, it is unclear how best to interpret the results of such tests.263 264 If done, the planned testing methods should be described in the trial protocol.", "Example 1": "Assessments regarding clinical recovery will be conducted by an assessor blind to treatment allocation.

Because missing data can be a major threat to trial validity and statistical power, non-adherence should not be an automatic reason for ceasing to collect data from the trial participant prior to study completion. In particular for randomised trials, it is widely recommended that all participants be included in an intention to treat analysis, regardless of adherence (Item 20c).\n\nProtocols should describe any retention strategies and define which outcome data will be recorded from protocol non-adherers.152 Protocols should also detail any plans to record the reasons for non-adherence (eg, discontinuation of intervention due to harms versus lack of efficacy) and non-retention (ie, consent withdrawn; lost to follow-up), as this information can influence the handling of missing data and interpretation of results.", "Example 1": "5.2.2 Retention\n...As with recruitment, retention addresses all levels of participant.\n\nAt the parent and student level, study investigators and staff:\nProvide written feedback to all parents of participating students about the results of the \u201chealth screenings\u201d . . .\nMaintain interest in the study through materials and mailings . . .\nSend letters to parents and students prior to the final data collection, reminding them of the upcoming data collection and the incentives the students will receive.\n\nAt the school level, study investigators and staff:\nProvide periodic communications via newsletters and presentations to inform the school officials/staff, students, and parents about type 2 diabetes, the current status of the study, and plans for the next phase, as well as to acknowledge their support.\n\n...Become a presence in the intervention schools to monitor and maintain consistency in implementation, . . . be as flexible as possible with study schedule and proactive in resolving conflicts with schools.\nProvide school administration and faculty with the schedule or grid showing how the intervention fits into the school calendar . . .\nSolicit support from parents, school officials/staff, and teachers . . .\nProvide periodic incentives for school staff and teachers.\nProvide monetary incentives for the schools that increase with each year of the study...\nTable 6 Excerpts from table showing compensation provided in study\nhttp://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7586.long", "Example 2": "5.4 Infant Evaluations in the Case of Treatment Discontinuation or Study Withdrawal\nAll randomized infants completing the 18-month evaluation schedule will have fulfilled the infant clinical and laboratory evaluation requirements for the study...\n\nAll randomized infants who are prematurely discontinued from study drug will be considered off study drug/on study and will follow the same schedule of events as those infants who continue study treatment except adherence assessment.

This information facilitates an assessment of adherence to applicable standards and regulations.\n\nDifferences in data entry methods can affect the trial in terms of data accuracy,268 cost, and efficiency.271 For example, when compared with paper case report forms, electronic data capture can reduce the time required for data entry, query resolution, and database release by combining data entry with data collection (Item 18a).271 277 When data are collected on paper forms, data entry can be performed locally or at a central site. Local data entry can enable fast correction of missing or inaccurate data, while central data entry facilitates blinding (masking), standardisation, and training of a core group of data entry personnel.\n\nRaw, non-numeric data are usually coded for ease of data storage, review, tabulation, and analysis. It is important to define standard coding practices to reduce errors and observer variation. When data entry and coding are performed by different individuals, it is particularly important that the personnel use unambiguous, standardised terminology and abbreviations to avoid misinterpretation.\n\nAs with data collection (Item 18a), standard processes are often implemented to improve the accuracy of data entry and coding.281 284 Common examples include double data entry296; verification that the data are in the proper format (eg, integer) or within an expected range of values; and independent source document verification of a random subset of data to identify missing or apparently erroneous values.

For trials with more than two study groups, it is important to specify in the protocol which comparisons (of two or more study groups) will be performed and, if relevant, which will be the main comparison of interest. The same principle of specifying the main comparison also applies when there is more than one outcome, including when the same variable is measured at several time points (Item 12). Any statistical approaches to account for multiple comparisons and time points should also be described.\n\nFinally, different trial designs dictate the most appropriate analysis plan and any additional relevant information that should be included in the protocol. For example, cluster, factorial, crossover, and within-person randomised trials require specific statistical considerations, such as how clustering will be handled in a cluster randomised trial.", "Example 1": "The intervention arm (SMS [short message system (text message)]) will be compared against the control (SOC [standard of care]) for all primary analysis. We will use chi-squared test for binary outcomes, and T-test for continuous outcomes. For subgroup analyses, we will use regression methods with appropriate interaction terms (respective subgroup\u00d7treatment group). Multivariable analyses will be based on logistic regression . . . for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes. We will examine the residual to assess model assumptions and goodness-of-fit. For timed endpoints such as mortality we will use the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for adjusting for baseline variables. We will calculate Relative Risk (RR) and RR Reductions (RRR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals to compare dichotomous variables, and difference in means will be used for additional analysis of continuous variables. P-values will be reported to four decimal places with p-values less than 0.001 reported as p < 0.001. Up-to-date versions of SAS (Cary, NC) and SPSS (Chicago, IL) will be used to conduct analyses. For all tests, we will use 2-sided p-values with alpha\u22640.05 level of significance. We will use the Bonferroni method to appropriately adjust the overall level of significance for multiple primary outcomes, and secondary outcomes.\n\nTo assess the impact of potential clustering for patients cared by the same clinic, we will use generalized estimating equations [GEE] assuming an exchangeable correlation structure. Table [7] provides a summary of methods of analysis for each variable. Professional academic statisticians (LT, RN) blinded to study groups will conduct all analyses.\nTable 7 Variables, measures, and methods of analysis (reproduced from original table http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e7586.long", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 33, "EQ_number": 4.046, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Statistical methods", "display_number": "20b", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "SPIRIT", "RG checklist heading 1": "Methods: Data collection, management, and analysis", "RG checklist heading 2": "Statistics: additional analyses", "RG Checklist text": "Methods for any additional analyses (eg, subgroup and adjusted analyses)", "text_long": "Subgroup analysis\nSubgroup analyses explore whether estimated treatment effects vary significantly between subcategories of trial participants. As these data can help tailor healthcare decisions to individual patients, a modest number of prespecified subgroup analyses can be sensible.\n\nHowever, subgroup analyses are problematic if they are inappropriately conducted or selectively reported. Subgroup analyses described in protocols or grant applications do not match those reported in subsequent publications for more than two thirds of randomised trials, suggesting that subgroup analyses are often selectively reported or not prespecified.6 7 305 Post hoc (data driven) analyses have a high risk of spurious findings and are discouraged.306 Conducting a large number of subgroup comparisons leads to issues of multiplicity, even when all of the comparisons have been pre-specified. Furthermore, when subgroups are based on variables measured after randomisation, the analyses are particularly susceptible to bias.307\n\nPreplanned subgroup analyses should be clearly specified in the protocol with respect to the precise baseline variables to be examined, the definition of the subgroup categories (including cut-off boundaries for continuous or ordinal variables), the statistical method to be used, and the hypothesised direction of the subgroup effect based on plausibility.308 309\n\nAdjusted analysis\nSome trials prespecify adjusted analyses to account for imbalances between study groups (eg, chance imbalance across study groups in small trials), improve power, or account for a known prognostic variable. Adjustment is often recommended for any variables used in the allocation process (eg, in stratified randomisation), on the principle that the analysis strategy should match the design.310 Most trial protocols and publications do not adequately address issues of adjustment, particularly the description of variables.6 310\n\nIt is important that trial investigators indicate in the protocol if there is an intention to perform or consider adjusted analyses, explicitly specifying any variables for adjustment and how continuous variables will be handled. When both unadjusted and adjusted analyses are intended, the main analysis should be identified (Item 20a). It may not always be clear, in advance, which variables will be important for adjustment. In such situations, the objective criteria to be used to select variables should be prespecified. As with subgroup analyses, adjustment variables based on post-randomisation data rather than baseline data can introduce bias.311 312", "Example 1": "We plan to conduct two subgroup analyses, both with strong biological rationale and possible interaction effects. The first will compare hazard ratios of re-operation based upon the degree of soft tissue injury (Gustilo-Anderson Type I/II open fractures vs. Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIA/B open fractures). The second will compare hazard ratios of re-operation between fractures of the upper and lower extremity. We will test if the treatment effects differ with fracture types and extremities by putting their main effect and interaction terms in the Cox regression. For the comparison of pressure, we anticipate that the low/gravity flow will be more effective in the Type IIIA-B open fracture than in the Type I/II open fracture, and be more effective in the upper extremity than the lower extremity. For the comparison of solution, we anticipate that soap will do better in the Type IIIA-B open fracture than in the Type I/II open fracture, and better in the upper extremity than the lower extremity.", "Example 2": "A secondary analysis of the primary endpoint will adjust for those pre-randomization variables which might reasonably be expected to be predictive of favorable outcomes.

To prevent attrition bias, outcome data obtained from all participants are included in the data analysis, regardless of protocol adherence (Items 11c and 18b).249 250 These two conditions (ie, all participants, as randomised) define an \u201cintention to treat\u201d analysis, which is widely recommended as the preferred analysis strategy.17\n\nSome trialists use other types of data analyses (commonly labelled as \u201cmodified intention to treat\u201d or \u201cper protocol\u201d) that exclude data from certain participants\u2014such as those who are found to be ineligible after randomisation or who deviate from the intervention or follow-up protocols. This exclusion of data from protocol non-adherers can introduce bias, particularly if the frequency of and the reasons for non-adherence vary between the study groups.314 315 In some trials, the participants to be included in the analysis will vary by outcome\u2014for example, analysis of harms (adverse events) is sometimes restricted to participants who received the intervention, so that absence or occurrence of harm is not attributed to a treatment that was never received.\n\nProtocols should explicitly describe which participants will be included in the main analyses (eg, all randomised participants, regardless of protocol adherence) and define the study group in which they will be analysed (eg, as randomised). In one cohort of randomised trials approved in 1994-5, this information was missing in half of the protocols.6 The ambiguous use of labels such as \u201cintention to treat\u201d or \u201cper protocol\u201d should be avoided unless they are fully defined in the protocol.6 314 Most analyses labelled as \u201cintention to treat\u201d do not actually adhere to its definition because of missing data or exclusion of participants who do not meet certain post-randomisation criteria (eg, specific level of adherence to intervention).6 316 Other ambiguous labels such as \u201cmodified intention to treat\u201d are also variably defined from one trial to another.314\n\nIn addition to defining the analysis population, it is necessary to address the problem of missing data in the protocol. Most trials have some degree of missing data,317 318 which can introduce bias depending on the pattern of \u201cmissingness\u201d (eg, not missing at random). Strategies to maximise follow-up and prevent missing data, as well as the recording of reasons for missing data, are thus important to develop and document (Item 18b).152\n\nThe protocol should also state how missing data will be handled in the analysis and detail any planned methods to impute (estimate) missing outcome data, including which variables will be used in the imputation process (if applicable).152 Different statistical approaches can lead to different results and conclusions,317 319 but one study found that only 23% of trial protocols specified the planned statistical methods to account for missing data.6\n\nImputation of missing data allows the analysis to conform to intention to treat analysis but requires strong assumptions that are untestable and may be hard to justify.152 318 320 321 Methods of multiple imputation are more complex but are widely preferred to single imputation methods (eg, last observation carried forward; baseline observation carried forward), as the latter introduce greater bias and produce confidence intervals that are too narrow.152 320 321 322 Specific issues arise when outcome data are missing for crossover or cluster randomised trials.323 Finally, sensitivity analyses are highly recommended to assess the robustness of trial results under different methods of handling missing data.152 324", "Example 1": "Nevertheless, we propose to test non-inferiority using two analysis sets; the intention-to-treat set, considering all patients as randomized regardless of whether they received the randomized treatment, and the \u201cper protocol\u201d analysis set. Criteria for determining the \u201cper protocol\u201d group assignment would be established by the Steering Committee and approved by the PSMB [performance and safety monitoring board] before the trial begins. Given our expectation that very few patients will crossover or be lost to follow-up, these analyses should agree very closely. We propose declaring medical management non-inferior to interventional therapy, only if shown to be non-inferior using both the \u201cintention to treat\u201d and \u201cper protocol\u201d analysis sets.\n...\n10.4.7 Imputation Procedure for Missing Data\nWhile the analysis of the primary endpoint (death or stroke) will be based on a log-rank test and, therefore, not affected by patient withdrawals (as they will be censored) provided that dropping out is unrelated to prognosis; other outcomes, such as the Rankin Score at five years post-randomization, could be missing for patients who withdraw from the trial. We will report reasons for withdrawal for each randomization group and compare the reasons qualitatively . . . The effect that any missing data might have on results will be assessed via sensitivity analysis of augmented data sets. Dropouts (essentially, participants who withdraw consent for continued follow-up) will be included in the analysis by modern imputation methods for missing data.\n\nThe main feature of the approach is the creation of a set of clinically reasonable imputations for the respective outcome for each dropout. This will be accomplished using a set of repeated imputations created by predictive models based on the majority of participants with complete data. The imputation models will reflect uncertainty in the modeling process and inherent variability in patient outcomes, as reflected in the complete data.\n\nAfter the imputations are completed, all of the data (complete and imputed) will be combined and the analysis performed for each imputed-and-completed dataset. Rubin\u2019s method of multiple (ie, repeated) imputation will be used to estimate treatment effect. We propose to use 15 datasets (an odd number to allow use of one of the datasets to represent the median analytic result).\n\nThese methods are preferable to simple mean imputation, or simple \u201cbest-worst\u201d or \u201cworst-worst\u201d imputation, because the categorization of patients into clinically meaningful subgroups, and the imputation of their missing data by appropriately different models, accords well with best clinical judgment concerning the likely outcomes of the dropouts, and therefore will enhance the trial\u2019s results.", "Example 2": "", "Example 3": "", "Example 4": "", "Example 5": ""}, {"number": 35, "EQ_number": 4.049, "EQ heading 1": "Methods", "EQ heading 2": "Minimising bias", "EQ heading 3": "Data management", "display_number": "21a", "REPORTING GUIDELINE": "SPIRIT", "RG checklist heading 1": "Methods: Monitoring", "RG checklist heading 2": "Data monitoring: formal committee", "RG Checklist text": "Composition of data monitoring committee (DMC); summary of its role and reporting structure; statement of whether it is independent from the sponsor and competing interests; and reference to where further details about its charter can be found, if not in the protocol.

In principle, a trial should be modified or discontinued when the accumulated data have sufficiently disturbed the clinical equipoise that justified the initiation of the trial. Data monitoring can also inform aspects of trial conduct, such as recruitment, and identify the need to make adjustments.\n\nThe decision to have a data monitoring committee (DMC) will be influenced by local standards. While certain trials warrant some form of data monitoring, many do not need a formal committee,326 such as trials with a short duration or known minimal risks. A DMC was described in 65% (98/150) of cancer trial protocols with time-to-event outcomes in Italy in 2000-5,327 and in 17% (12/70) of protocols for Danish randomised trials approved in 1994-5.6 About 40% of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007-2010 reported having a DMC.328 The protocol should either state that there will be a DMC and provide further details, as discussed below, or indicate that there will not be a DMC, preferably with reasons.\n\nWhen formal data monitoring is performed, it is often done by a DMC consisting of members from a variety of disciplines.254 329 The primary role of a DMC is to periodically review the accumulating data and determine if a trial should be modified or discontinued. The DMC does not usually have executive power; rather, it communicates the outcome of its deliberations to the trial steering committee or sponsor.\n\nIndependence, in particular from the sponsor and trial investigators, is a key characteristic of the DMC and can be broadly defined as the committee comprising members who are \u201ccompletely uninvolved in the running of the trial and who cannot be unfairly influenced (either directly or indirectly) by people, or institutions, involved in the trial.\u201d254 DMC members are usually required to declare any competing interests (Item 28). Among the 12 trial protocols that described a DMC and were approved in Denmark in 1994-5,6 four explicitly stated that the DMC was independent from the sponsor and investigators; three had non-independent DMCs; and independence was unclear for the remaining five protocols.\n\nThe protocol should name the chair and members of the DMC. If the members are not yet known, the protocol can indicate the intended size and characteristics of the membership until further details are available. The protocol should also indicate the DMC\u2019s roles and responsibilities, planned method of functioning, and degree of independence from those conducting, sponsoring, or funding the trial.254 330 331 A charter is recommended for detailing this information331; if this charter is not appended to the protocol, the protocol should indicate whether a charter exists or will be developed, and if so, where it can be accessed.", "Example 1": "Appendix 3. Charter and responsibilities of the Data Monitoring Committee\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established. The DMC is independent of the study organisers. During the period of recruitment to the study, interim analyses will be supplied, in strict confidence, to the DMC, together with any other analyses that the committee may request. This may include analyses of data from other comparable trials. In the light of these interim analyses, the DMC will advise the TSC [trial steering committee] if, in its view:\n\na) the active intervention has been proved, beyond reasonable doubt*, to be different from the control (standard management) for all or some types of participants, and\nb) the evidence on the economic outcomes is sufficient to guide a decision from health care providers regarding recommendation of early lens extraction for PACG [primary angle closure glaucoma].\nThe TSC can then decide whether or not to modify intake to the trial. Unless this happens, however, the TSC, PMG [project management group], clinical collaborators and study office staff (except those who supply the confidential analyses) will remain ignorant of the interim results.\nThe frequency of interim analyses will depend on the judgement of the Chair of the DMC, in consultation with the TSC.

Criteria for stopping for harm are often different from those for benefit and might not employ a formal statistical criterion.333 Stopping for futility occurs in instances where, if the study were to continue, it is unlikely that an important effect would be seen (ie, low chance of rejecting null hypothesis). Multiple analyses of the accumulating data increase the risk of a false positive (type I) error, and various statistical strategies have been developed to compensate for this inflated risk.254 333 334 335 Aside from informing stopping guidelines, prespecified interim analyses can be used for other trial adaptations such as sample size re-estimation, alteration to the proportion of participants allocated to each study group, and changes to eligibility criteria.111\n\nA complete description of any interim analysis plan, even if it is only to be performed at the request of an oversight body (eg, DMC), should be provided in the protocol\u2014including the statistical methods, who will perform the analyses, and when they will be conducted (timing and indications). If applicable, details should also be provided about the decision criteria\u2014statistical or other\u2014that will be adopted to judge the interim results as part of a guideline for early stopping or other adaptations.

In the context of clinical trials, it can be difficult to attribute causation for a given adverse event. An adverse effect is a type of adverse event that can be attributed to the intervention.\n\nHarms can be specified as primary or secondary outcomes (Item 12) or can be assessed as part of routine monitoring. To the extent possible, distinctions should be made between adverse events that are anticipated versus unanticipated, and solicited versus unsolicited, because expectation can influence the number and perceived severity of recorded events.

Plasma will allow the analysis of additional biomarkers . . . This DNA will be used (among other possible uses) for studies to investigate polymorphisms in genes which may influence prostate cancer risk . . .\n\nThe PCPT WBC [white blood cell] sample will be available to PCPT investigators as well as outside researchers who have important, timely hypotheses to test. \nBecause the sample bank is a limited resource, proposals to use it will be evaluated in terms of scientific relevance, significance, and validity as well as the potential impact of the proposed study. The amount and type of material needed will also be considered and the efficient use of material will be required. Strict confidentiality will be exercised and the information provided to investigators will not contain personal identifiers.\n\nWhen specific uses of the WBC samples are approved, the SWOG-9217 protocol will be amended.\n\nParticipation in this research is not required for continued participation in the PCPT.\n\n3.0 Methods\n3.1 Because the original model consent form did not specifically address genetic studies, participants will be asked to sign an additional consent form to document their consent to the collection and submission of additional blood samples for storage and future testing (including genetic analysis).\n3.2 Institutions will be asked to submit additional materials from participants who consent to the additional blood collection. The blood is to be collected, processed and shipped as described in the PCPT Study Manual.\n3.3 NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Development Center (FCRDC) in Frederick, Maryland will serve as the processing, aliquotting and storage facility.\n3.4 Upon arrival at FCRDC the blood will be pooled and centrifuged. Plasma will be separated into 5 x 1.8 ml aliquots and frozen . . .\n3.5 All samples will be logged in and aliquots will be bar coded with a unique storage ID. These data will be electronically transmitted to the Statistical Center for verification.\n3.6 The scientists who will carry out analyses on these materials will not have access to personal identifiers and will not be able to link the results of these tests to personal identifier information. No individual results will be presented in publications or other reports...\n3.7 Participants will not be informed on an individual basis of any results from these studies...\n4.0 Sample analysis\n4.1 Investigators planning to submit NIH [National Institutes of Health] grant applications must obtain approval for their study and specimen access from the PCPT Serum and Tissue Utilization Committee before submission of a grant proposal. Potential investigators will be required to submit a brief abstract and 1-4 page outline... This proposal will be circulated for review to members of the PCPT Serum and Tissue Utilization Committee and two ad hoc members having relevant expertise...\n4.2 It is anticipated that proposals will be reviewed once a year . . .
