CONSORT,CONSORT-SPI,randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of social and psychological interventions.,This checklist is an extension of CONSORT with modified and additional items for reporting trials of social and psychological intereventions,"Social and psychological interventions are actions intended to modify processes and systems that are social and psychological in nature (such as cognitions, emotions, behaviours, norms, relationships, and salient aspects of the environment) and are hypothesised to be influences on outcomes of interest. Social and psychological interventions can be complex in several ways. For example, these interventions cover an assortment of coordinated actions—such as practices, programmes, and policies—that often involve multiple interacting components. The units targeted by these interventions may include individuals, groups, or even places, and outcomes may be measured at any of these levels. The behaviours of both providers and recipients must be understood if the intervention and its effects are to be understood. Social and psychological interventions may not follow strictly standardised implementation procedures, and effects may depend on aspects of the hard-to-control dynamic systems in which they occur. For these reasons, readers of social and psychological intervention research are interested in more than just effect estimates—they require information about how and why these interventions work, for whom, and under what conditions.",https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort-spi/,https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-018-2733-1,https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-018-2735-z,"Montgomery P, Grant S, Mayo-Wilson E, Macdonald G, Michie S, Hopewell S, Moher D; on behalf of the CONSORT-SPI Group.

PRISMA,PRISMA-EQUITY,systematic reviews with a focus on health equity,This checklist is an extenstion of the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses,"Health equity is defined as the absence of avoidable and unfair inequalities in health. The moral judgment of fairness involves an ethical debate about freedom, capabilities, and opportunities with consideration of context. Rigorous scientific measurement and evaluation of the effects of policies on health equity is necessary to meet the goals of the World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health (WHO CSDH). Studies of the average effects of interventions, which control for confounding across individual and population-level characteristics, hide their impact on health equity. Using average effects to guide policy may even result in increases in health inequalities despite good intentions, as shown by an assessment of the impacts of country-level efforts in child health. Well-designed, scientific evaluations that assess effects on health equity are needed to break the poverty trap. Systematic reviews are promoted as a useful and comprehensive source of evidence for decision making but need to include evidence about health equity to be useful to policy makers in areas where there is health inequity.",https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma-equity/,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001333,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-015-0219-2,"Welch V, Petticrew M, Tugwell P, Moher D, O'Neill J, Waters E, White H; PRISMA-Equity Bellagio group.

Cupping practice has been, and continues to be, a vital part of nearly every traditional medical system in Asia (e.g., China, Korea, the Middle East) and Europe.  The quality of reporting of cupping trials is generally poor and results in a great deal of avoidable waste in research.
