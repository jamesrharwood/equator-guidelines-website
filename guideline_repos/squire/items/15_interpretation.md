## Examples

### Example 1

> (a) After QI interventions, the percentage of patients attending
> four or more clinic visits significantly improved, and in 2012 we met
> our goal of 90% of patients attending four or more times a year. A
> systematic approach to scheduling processes, timely rescheduling of
> patients who missed appointments and monitoring of attendance resulted
> in a significant increase in the number of patients who met the CFF
> national recommendation of four or more visits per year.[@R64]

> (b) Although the increase in the percentage of patients with greater
> than 25th centile for BMI/W-L from 80% to 82% might seem small, it
> represents a positive impact on a few more patients and provides more
> opportunities for improvement. Our data are in agreement with Johnson
> *et al*. (2003), who reported that frequent monitoring among other
> interventions made possible due to patients being seen more in clinic
> was associated with improved outcomes in CF.[@R64]

> (c) We learned that families are eager to have input and be
> involved...participation in the(learning and leadership
> collaborative) resulted in a positive culture change at the ACH CF
> Care Center regarding the use of QI methods.[@R64]

> (d) We noticed our clinic attendance started to improve before
> the(intervention) processes were fully implemented. We speculate
> this was due to the heightened awareness of our efforts by patients,
> families and our CF team.[@R64]

> (e) Replication of these processes could be hindered by lack of
> personnel, lack of buy-in by the hospital administration and lack of
> patient/family involvement....barriers to attendance included rising
> fuel costs, transportation limitations, child care issues, missed
> workdays by caregivers and average low-income population.[@R64]

### Example 2

> The direct involvement of patients and families...allowed us to
> address the social and medical barriers to adherence. Their input was
> invaluable since they live with the treatment burden that is a daily
> part of CF care...the in-clinic patient demonstration gave staff the
> ability to upgrade or replace equipment that was not
> functioning.[@R65]

> We found that following a simple algorithm helped to maintain
> consistency in our program...the simplicity of this program makes it
> easily incorporated into routine CF clinic visits.[@R65]

## Explanation

In the first example, Berlinski, *et al*[@R64] describe the implications
of their improvement efforts by highlighting that they increased the
proportion of CF patients receiving four clinic visits a year and
achieved secondary improvements on a nutritional outcome and on the
culture of their context. The authors also offer alternative
explanations for outcomes, including factors which might have confounded
the asserted relationship between intervention and outcome--- namely
that performance on the primary outcome began to improve well before
implementation of the intervention. This provides insight into what the
actual drivers of the outcome might have been, and can be very helpful
to others seeking to replicate or modify the intervention. Finally,
their comparison of their results to that of a similar study provides a
basis for considerations of feasibility, sustainability, spread and
replication of the intervention.

The second example, from Zanni, *et al*[@R65] found that the simplicity
of their intervention could maximise ease of implementation, suggesting
that costs and trade-offs are likely to be minimal for replication in
similar contexts. Conversely, Berlinksi *et al*[@R64] cite barriers to
replicating and sustaining their work, including staffing, leadership,
population socioeconomic characteristics and informatics issues, each of
which could present cost or trade-off considerations that leadership
will need to consider to support implementation and sustainability.
Additionally, both Berlinski *et al* and Zanni, *et al* observe that
patient and family involvement in the planning and intervention process
simultaneously improved the context and effectiveness of the
intervention.
