title: "12. Ethical considerations"

## What to write

Ethical aspects of implementing and studying the intervention(s) and
how they were addressed, including, but not limited to, formal ethics
review and potential conflict(s) of interest.

## Explanation

SQUIRE 2.0 provides guidance to authors of improvement activities in
reporting on the ethical implications of their work. Those reading
published improvement reports should be assured that potential ethics
issues have been considered in the design, implementation and
dissemination of the activity. The example given highlights key ethical
issues that may be reported by authors, including whether or not
independent review occurred, and any potential conflicts of
interest.[@R49] These issues are directly described in the quoted
sections.

Expectations for the ethical review of research and improvement work
vary between countries[@R57] and may also vary between institutions. At
some institutions, both quality improvement and human subject research
are reviewed using the same mechanism. Other institutions designate
separate review mechanisms for human subject research and quality
improvement work.[@R56] In the example below, from the UK, Hands *et
al*[@R48] report that the improvement activity described was reviewed
and approved by a regional research ethics committee. In another
example, from the USA, the authors of a report describing a
hospital-wide improvement activity to increase the rate of influenza
vaccinations indicate that their work was reviewed by the facility's
quality management office.[@R58]

Avoiding potential conflict of interest is as important in improvement
work as it is in research. The authors in the example paper indicate the
presence or absence of potential conflicts of interests, under the
heading, 'Competing Interests.' Here, the authors provide the reader
with clear and detailed information concerning any potential conflict of
information.

Both the original and SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines stipulate that reports of
interventions to improve the safety, value or quality of healthcare
should explicitly describe how potential ethical concerns were reviewed
and addressed in development and implementation of the intervention.
This is an essential step for ensuring the integrity of efforts to
improve healthcare, and should therefore be explicitly described in
published reports.

## Example

> Close monitoring of (vital) signs increases the chance of early

> has the potential to reduce mortality, morbidity, hospital length of
> stay and costs. Despite this, the frequency of vital signs monitoring
> in hospital often appears to be inadequate...Therefore we used our
> hospital's large vital signs database to study the pattern of the
> recording of vital signs observations throughout the day and examine
> its relationship with the monitoring frequency component of the
> clinical escalation protocol...The large study demonstrates that the
> pattern of recorded vital signs observations in the study hospital was
> not uniform across a 24â€…h period...(the study led to) identification
