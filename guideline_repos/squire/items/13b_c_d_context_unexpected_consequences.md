## What to write

A.  Contextual elements that interacted with the interventions

B.  Observed associations between outcomes, interventions and relevant
    contextual factors

C.  Unintended consequences such as benefits, harms, unexpected results,
    problems or failures associated with the intervention(s)

## Explanation

One of the challenges in reporting healthcare improvement studies is the
effect of context on the success or failure of the intervention(s). The
most commonly reported contextual elements that may interact with
interventions are structural variables including organisational/practice
type, volume, payer mix, electronic health record use and geographical
location. Other contextual elements associated with healthcare
improvement success include top management leadership, organisational
structure, data infrastructure/information technology, physician
involvement in activities, motivation to change and team
leadership.[@R60] In this example, the authors provided descriptive
information about the structural elements of the individual practices,
including type of practice, payer mix, geographical setting and use of
electronic health records. The authors noted variability in improvement
in diabetes and asthma measures across the practices, and examined how
characteristics of practice leadership affected the change process for
an initiative to improve diabetes and asthma care. Practice leadership
was measured monthly by the community based practice coach at each site.
For analyses, these scores were reduced into low (0--1) and high (2--3)
groups. Practice change ratings were also assigned by the practice
coaches indicating the degree of implementation and use of patient
registries, care templates, protocols and patient self-management
support tools. Local leadership showed no association with most of the
clinical measures; however, local leadership involvement was
significantly associated with implementation of the process tools used
to improve outcomes. The authors use tables to display these
associations clearly to the reader.

In addition, the authors use the information from the coaches'
ratings to further explore this concept of practice leadership. The
authors conducted semistructured focus group interviews for a sample of
12 of the 76 practices based on improvement in clinical measures and
improvement in practice change score. Two focus groups were conducted in
each practice including one with practice clinicians and administrators
and one with front-line staff. Three themes emerged from these
interviews that explicated the concept of practice leadership in these
groups. While two of the themes reflect contextual elements that are
often cited in the literature (visionary leader and engaged team), the
authors addressed an unexpected theme about the role of the middle
(operational) manager. This operational leader was often reported to be
a nurse or nurse practitioner with daily interactions with physicians
and staff, who appeared to be influential in facilitating change. The
level of detail provided about the specifics of practice leadership can
be useful to readers who are engaged in their own improvement work.
Although no harms or failures related to the work were described,
transparent reporting of negative results is as important as reporting
successful ones.

In this example, the authors used a mixed methods approach in which
practice leadership and engagement was quantitatively rated by
improvement coaches as well as qualitatively evaluated using focus
groups. The use of qualitative methods enhanced understanding of the
context of practice leadership. This mixed methods approach is not a
requirement for healthcare improvement studies as the influence of
contextual elements can be assessed in many ways. For example, Cohen *et
al* simply describe the probable impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on
their work to increase influenza vaccination rates in hospitalised
patients,[@R58] providing important contextual information to assist the
reader's understanding of the results.

## Example

> **Quantitative results**
>
> In terms of QI efforts, two-thirds of the 76 practices (67%) focused
> on diabetes and the rest focused on asthma. Forty-two percent of
> practices were family medicine practices, 26% were pediatrics, and 13%
> were internal medicine. The median percent of patients covered by
> Medicaid and with no insurance was 20% and 4%, respectively. One-half
> of the practices were located in rural settings and one-half used
> electronic health records. For each diabetes or asthma measure,
> between 50% and 78% of practices showed improvement (ie, a positive
> trend) in the first year.
>
> TablesÂ 2 and 3 show the associations of leadership with clinical
> measures and with practice change scores for implementation of various
> tools, respectively. Leadership was significantly associated with only
> 1 clinical measure, the proportion of patients having nephropathy
> screening (OR=1.37: 95% CI 1.08 to 1.74). Inclusion of practice
> engagement reduced these odds, but the association remained
> significant. The odds of making practice changes were greater for
> practices with higher leadership scores at any given time
> (ORs=1.92--6.78). Inclusion of practice engagement, which was also
> significantly associated with making practice changes, reduced these
> odds (ORs=2.41 to 4.20), but the association remained significant
> for all changes except for registry implementation
>
> **Qualitative results**
>
> Among the 12 practices interviewed, 5 practices had 3 or fewer
> clinicians and 7 had 4 or more (range=1--32). Seven practices had
> high ratings of practice change by the coach. One-half were NCQA
> (National Committee for Quality Assurance) certified as a
> patient-centered medical home. These practices were similar to the
> quantitative analysis sample except for higher rates of electronic
> health record use and Community Care of North Carolina Medicaid
> membership...
>
> Leadership-related themes from the focus groups included having (1)
> someone with a vision about the importance of the work, (2) a middle
> manager who implemented the vision, and (3) a team who believed in
> and were engaged in the work....Although the practice management
> provided the vision for change, patterns emerged among the practices
> that suggested leaders with a vision are a necessary, but not
> sufficient condition for successful implementation.
>
> **Leading from the middle**
>
> All practices had leaders who initiated the change, but practices with
> high and low practice change ratings reported very different
> 'operational' leaders. Operational leaders in practices with low
> practice change ratings were generally the same clinicians, practice
> managers, or both who introduced the change. In contrast, in practices
> with high practice change ratings, implementation was led by someone
> other than the lead physician or top manager.."[@R59]
