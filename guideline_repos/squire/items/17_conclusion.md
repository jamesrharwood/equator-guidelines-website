## Explanation

The conclusion of a healthcare improvement paper should address the
overall usefulness of the work, including its potential for
dissemination and implications for the field, both in terms of practice
and policy. It may be included as a separate section in or after the
discussion section, or these components may be incorporated within a
single overall discussion section.

The authors of this report highlight the usefulness of their research
with reference to 'the national(US) emphasis on reduction of
readmission by payers'. They also refer throughout the paper to the
debates and research around appropriate nurse staffing levels, and the
impact of nurse staffing levels on the sustainability of quality
improvement initiatives in general, with reference to the key role of
nurses in improving care and evidence that nursing staff levels are
associated with delivery of high quality care. Although the authors
don't refer directly to potential for spread to other contexts, the
generalisability of their findings is discussed in a separate section of
the discussion (not included here).

In this example, the authors refer to 'implications for hospital
administrators' because their findings 'suggest that hospitals might
also achieve reduction in readmissions by focusing on the number of
patients assigned to nurses'. They also observe that these findings
speak to 'the validity of the California minimum staffing ratio for
paediatric care'. Perhaps they could have suggested more in terms of
implications for policy, for example what their findings might mean for
the potential of payer organisations to influence nurse staffing levels
through their contracts, or for broader government legislation on
nurse-patient ratios. However, in their discussion they also recognise
the limitations of a single study to inform policy decisions.

The need for further study is emphasised in the wider discussion
section. The authors note that 'more research is needed to better
understand the reasons for children's readmissions and thus identify
which ones are potentially preventable', calling for 'additional
research on both paediatric readmission measures and the relationship
between nursing care delivery, nurse staffing levels and readmissions'.
In writing about healthcare improvement, it is important that the
authors' conclusions are appropriately related to their findings,
reflecting their validity and generalisability, and their potential to
inform practice. In this case, direct recommendations to change practice
are appropriately withheld given the need for further research.

## Example

> We have found that average paediatric nurse staffing ratios are
> significantly associated with hospital readmission for children with
> common medical and surgical conditions. To our knowledge, this study
> is the first to explicitly examine and find an association between
> staffing ratios and hospital readmission in paediatrics... Our
> findings have implications for hospital administrators given the
> national emphasis on reduction of readmissions by payers. The role of
> nursing care in reducing readmissions has traditionally focused on
> nurse-led discharge planning programmes in the inpatient setting and
> nurse-directed home care for patients with complex or chronic
> conditions.
>
> While these nurse-oriented interventions have been shown to
> significantly reduce readmissions, our findings suggest that hospitals
> might also achieve reductions in readmission by focusing on the number
> of patients assigned to nurses. In paediatrics, limiting nurses'
> workloads to four or fewer patients appears to have benefits in
> reducing readmissions.
>
> Further, hospitals are earnestly examining their discharge processes
> and implementing quality improvement programmes aimed at preparing
> patients and families to manage health condition(s) beyond the
> hospital. Quality improvement initiatives to improve inpatient care
> delivery often depend upon the sustained efforts of front-line
> workers, particularly nurses. Prior research shows that hospitals with
> better nurse staffing ratios deliver Joint Commission-recommended care
> for key conditions more reliably, highlighting the inter-relationship
> of nurse staffing levels and quality improvement success.
>
> The sustainability of quality improvement initiatives related to
> paediatric readmission may ultimately depend on nurses' ability to
> direct meaningful time and attention to such efforts.[@R67]
