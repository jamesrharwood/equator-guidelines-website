## What to write

Item 3. Nature and significance of the local problem.

Item 4. Summary of what is currently known about the problem, including relevant previous studies.

## Explanation

The introduction section of a quality improvement article clearly
identifies the current relevant evidence, the best practice standard
based on the current evidence and the gap in quality. A quality gap
describes the difference between practice at the local level and the
achievable evidence-based standard. The authors of this article describe
the problem and identify the quality gap by stating that "Examination of
a 10-month sample revealed only 63% of the patients received antibiotics
within 60 minutes of arrival and that the benchmark of <60 minutes and
that delays in delivering antibiotics led to poorer outcomes."[@R18] The
timing of antibiotic administration at the national level compared with
the local level provides an achievable standard of care, which helps the
authors determine the goal for their antibiotic administration
improvement project.

Providing a summary of the relevant evidence and what is known about the
problem provides background and support for the improvement project and
increases the likelihood for sustainable success. The contextual
information provided by describing the local system clarifies the
project and reflects upon how suboptimal care with antibiotic
administration negatively impacts quality. Missed diagnoses, delayed
treatments, increased morbidity and increased costs are associated with
a lack of quality, having relevance and implications at both the local
and national levels.

Improvement work can also be done on a national or regional level. In
this case, the term 'local' in the SQUIRE guidelines should be
interpreted more generally as the specific problem to be addressed. For
example, Murphy *et al* describe a national initiative addressing a
healthcare quality issue.[@R19] The introduction section in this article
also illuminates current relevant evidence, best practice based on the
current evidence, and the gap in quality. However, the quality gap
reported here is the difference in knowledge of statin use for patients
at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Ireland
compared with European clinical guidelines: "Despite strong evidence and
clinical guidelines recommending the use of statins for secondary
prevention, a gap exists between guidelines and practice ... A policy
response that strengthens secondary prevention, and improves risk
assessment and shared decision-making in the primary prevention of CVD
(cardiovascular disease) is required."[@R19]

Improvement work can also address a gap in knowledge, rather than
quality. For example, work might be done to develop tools to assess
patient experience for quality improvement purposes.[@R20] Interventions
to improve patient experience, or to enhance team communication about
patient safety[@R21] may also address quality problems, but in the
absence of an established, evidence-based standard.

## Example

> Central venous access devices place patients at risk for bacterial
> entry into the bloodstream, facilitate systemic spread, and contribute
> to the development of sepsis. Rapid recognition and antibiotic
> intervention in these patients, when febrile, are critical. Delays in
> time to antibiotic (TTA) delivery have been correlated with poor
> outcomes in febrile neutropenic patients.^2^ TTA was identified as a
> measure of quality of care in pediatric oncology centers, and a survey
> reported that most centers used a benchmark of <60 minutes after
> arrival, with >75% of pediatric cancer clinics having a mean TTA of
> \<60 minutes...

> The University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospitals ED provides care
