## What to write

A.  Description of the intervention(s) in sufficient detail that others
    could reproduce it

B.  Specifics of the team involved in the work

## Explanation

In the same way that reports of basic science experiments provide
precise details about the quantity, specifications and usage of
reagents, equipment, chemicals and materials needed to run an
experiment, so too should the description of the healthcare improvement
intervention include or reference enough detail that others could
reproduce it. Improvement efforts are rarely unimodal and descriptions
of each component of the intervention should be included. For additional
guidance regarding the reporting of interventions, readers are
encouraged to review the TIDieR guidelines:
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24609605>.

Â In the first example below[@R21] about the multisite I-PASS study to
improve paediatric handoff safety, the authors describe seven different
elements of the intervention, including a standardised mnemonic, several
educational programmes, a faculty development programme,
observation/feedback tools and even the publicity materials used to
promote the intervention. Every change that could have contributed to
the observed outcome is noted. Each element is briefly described and a
reference to a more detailed description provided so that interested
readers can seek more information. In this fashion, complete information
about the intervention is made available, yet the full details do not
overwhelm this report. Note that not all references are to peer-reviewed
literature as some are to curricular materials in the website MedEd
Portal (<https://www.mededportal.org>), and others are to online
materials.

The online supplementary appendix available with this report summarises
key elements of each component which is another option to make details
available to readers. The authors were careful to note situations in
which the intervention differed across sites. At two sites the written
handoff tool was built into word-processing programmes, not the
electronic medical record. Since interventions are often unevenly
applied or taken up, variation in the application of intervention
components across units, sites or clinicians is reported in this section
where applicable.

The characteristics of the team that conducted the intervention (for
instance, type and level of training, degree of experience, and
administrative and/or academic position of the personnel leading
workshops) and/or the personnel to whom the intervention was applied
should be specified. Often the influence of the people involved in the
project is as great as the project components themselves. The second
example below,[@R31] from an elegant study of the Hawthorne effect on
hand hygiene rates, succinctly describes both the staff that were being
studied and characteristics of the intervention personnel: the auditors
tracking hand hygiene rates.

## Examples

### Example 1

> We developed the I-PASS Handoff Bundle through an iterative process
> based on the best evidence from the literature, our previous
> experience, and our previously published conceptual model. The I-PASS
> Handoff Bundle included the following seven elements: the I-PASS
> mnemonic, which served as an anchoring component for oral and written
> handoffs and all aspects of the curriculum; a 2-hour workshop (to
> teach TeamSTEPPS teamwork and communication skills, as well as I-PASS
> handoff techniques), which was highly rated; a 1-hour role-playing
> and simulation session for practicing skills from the workshop; a
> computer module to allow for independent learning; a faculty
> development program; direct-observation tools used by faculty to
> provide feedback to residents; and a process-change and culture-change
> campaign, which included a logo, posters, and other materials to
> ensure program adoption and sustainability. A detailed description of
> all curricular elements and the I-PASS mnemonic have been published
> elsewhere and are provided in online supplementary appendix table,
> available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. I-PASS is
> copyrighted by Boston Children's Hospital, but all materials are
> freely available.
>
> Each site integrated the I-PASS structure into oral and written
> handoff processes; an oral handoff and a written handoff were expected
> for every patient. Written handoff tools with a standardized I-PASS
> format were built into the electronic medical record programs (at
> seven sites) or word-processing programs (at two sites). Each site
> also maintained an implementation log that was reviewed regularly to
> ensure adherence to each component of the handoff program.[@R21]

### Example 2

> All HCWs (healthcare workers) on the study units, including
> physicians, nurses and allied health professionals, were invited to
> participate in the overall study of the RTLS (real-time location
> system) through presentations by study personnel. Posters describing
> the RTLS and the study were also displayed on the participating
> units... Auditors wore white lab coats as per usual hospital practice
> and were not specifically identified as auditors but may have been
> recognisable to some HCWs. Auditors were blinded to the study
> hypothesis and conducted audits in accordance with the Ontario Just
> Clean Your Hands programme.[@R31]
