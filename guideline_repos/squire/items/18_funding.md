## What to write

Sources of funding that supported this work. Role, if any, of the
funding organisation in the design, implementation, interpretation and
reporting.

## Explanation

Sources of funding for quality improvement should be clearly stated at
the end of a manuscript in similar fashion to other scholarly reports.
Any organisation, institution or agency that contributed financially to
any part of the project should be listed. In this example, funding was
received from multiple sources including government, university and
foundation granting agencies.

Due to their financial interest in the quality improvement project,
funding sources have the potential to introduce bias in favour of
exaggerated effect size. The role of each funding source should be
described in sufficient detail, as in the example below, to allow
readers to assess whether these external parties may have influenced the
reporting of improvement outcomes. A recent paper by Trautner *et al*
provides a similar approach.[@R69]

## Example

> Funding/Support: This research was funded by the Canadian Institutes
> of Health Research, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care,
> the Green Shield Canada Foundation, the University of Toronto
> Department of Medicine, and the Academic Funding Plan Innovation Fund.
>
> Role of the Funder/Sponsor: None of the funder or sponsors had any
> role in the design of the study, the conduct of the study, the
> collection, management, analysis or interpretation of the data, or the
> preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to
> submit the manuscript for publication.[@R68]
