## What to write

Contextual elements considered important at the outset of introducing
the intervention(s)

## Explanation

Context is known to affect the process and outcome of interventions to
improve the quality of healthcare.[@R29] This section of a report should
describe the contextual factors that authors considered important at the
outset of the improvement initiative. The goal of including information
on context is twofold. First, describing the context in which the
initiative took place is necessary to assist readers in understanding
whether the intervention is likely to 'work' in their local environment,
and, more broadly, the generalisability of the finding. Second, it
enables the researchers to examine the role of context as a moderator of
successful intervention(s). Specific and relevant elements of context
thought to optimise the likelihood of success should be addressed in the
design of the intervention, and plans should be made a priori to measure
these factors and examine how they interact with the success of the
intervention.

Describing the context within the methods section orients the reader to
where the initiative occurred. In single-centre studies, this
description usually includes information about the location, patient
population, size, staffing, practice type, teaching status, system
affiliation and relevant processes in place at the start of the
intervention, as is demonstrated in the first example by Dandoy *et
al*[@R27] reporting a QI effort to reduce monitor alarms. Similar
information is also provided in aggregate for multicentre studies. In
the second example by Duncan *et al*,[@R28] a table is used to describe
the practice characteristics of the 21 participating paediatric primary
care practices, and includes information on practice type, practice
setting, practice size, patient characteristics and use of an electronic
health record. This information can be used by the reader to assess
whether his or her own practice setting is similar enough to the
practices included in this report to enable extrapolation of the
results. The authors state that they selected practices to achieve
diversity in these key contextual factors. This was likely done so that
the team could assess the effectiveness of the interventions in a range
of settings and increase the generalisability of the findings.

Any contextual factors believed a priori would impact the success of
their intervention should be specifically discussed in this section.
Although the authors' rationale is not explicitly stated, the example
suggests that they had specific hypotheses about key aspects of a
practice's context that would impact implementation of the
interventions. They addressed these contextual factors in the design of
their study in order to increase the likelihood that the intervention
would be successful. For example, they stated specifically that they
selected practices with previous healthcare improvement experience and
strong physician leadership. In addition, the authors noted that
practices were recruited through an existing research consortium,
indicating their belief that project sponsorship by an established
external network could impact success of the initiative. They also noted
that practices were made aware that American Board of Pediatrics
Maintenance of Certification Part 4 credit had been applied for but not
assured, implying that the authors believed incentives could impact
project success. While addressing context in the design of the
intervention may increase the likelihood of success, these choices limit
the generalisability of the findings to other similar practices with
prior healthcare improvement experience, strong physician leadership and
available incentives.

This example could have been strengthened by using a published framework
such as the Model for Understanding Success in Quality (MUSIQ),[@R10]
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR),[@R29]or the
Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS)
model[@R30] to identify the subset of relevant contextual factors that
would be examined.[@R10; @R11] The use of such frameworks is not a
requirement but a helpful option for approaching the issue of context.
The relevance of any particular framework can be determined by authors
based on the focus of their work---MUSIQ was developed specifically for
microsystem or organisational QI efforts, whereas CFIR and PARiHS were
developed more broadly to examine implementation of evidence or other
innovations.

If elements of context are hypothesised to be important, but are not
going to be addressed specifically in the design of the intervention,
plans to measure these contextual factors *prospectively* should be made
during the study design phase. In these cases, measurement of contextual
factors should be clearly described in the methods section, data about
how contextual factors interacted with the interventions should be
included in the results section, and the implications of these findings
should be explored in the discussion. For example, if the authors of the
examples below had chosen this approach, they would have measured
participating team's' prior healthcare improvement experience and
looked for differences in successful implementation based on whether
practices had prior experience or not. In cases where context was not
addressed prospectively, authors are still encouraged to explore the
impact of context on the results of intervention(s) in the discussion
section.

## Examples

### Example 1

> CCHMC (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center)is a large,
> urban pediatric medical center and the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)
> team performs 100 to 110 transplants per year. The BMT unit contains
> 24 beds and 60--70% of the patients on the floor are on cardiac
> monitors...The clinical providers...include 14 BMT attending
> physicians, 15 fellows, 7 NPs (nurse practitioners), and 6
> hospitalists...The BMT unit employs ∼130 bedside RNs (registered
> nurses) and 30 PCAs(patient care assistants). Family members take
> an active role...[@R27]

### Example 2

> Pediatric primary care practices were recruited through the AAP QuIIN
> (American Academy of Pediatrics Quality Improvement Innovation
> Network) and the Academic Pediatric Association's Continuity
> Research Network. Applicants were told that Maintenance of
> Certification (MOC) Part 4 had been applied for, but was not
> assured. Applicant practices provided information on their location,
> size, practice type, practice setting, patient population and
> experience with quality improvement (QI) and identified a 3-member
> physician-led core improvement team. .... Practices were selected to
> represent diversity in practice types, practice settings, and patient
> populations. In each selected practice the lead core team physician
> and in some cases the whole practice had previous QI
> experience...table 1 summarizes practice characteristics for the 21 project teams.[@R28]
