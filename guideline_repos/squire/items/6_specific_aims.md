## What to write

Purpose of the project and of this report

## Explanation

The specific aim of a project describes why it was conducted, and the
goal of the report. It is essential to state the aims of improvement
work clearly, completely and precisely. Specific aims should align with
the nature and significance of the problem, the gap in quality, safety
and value identified in the introduction, and reflect the rationale for
the intervention(s). The example given makes it clear that the goal of
this multisite initiative was to improve or reduce postoperative
respiratory failure by using a virtual breakthrough series.

When appropriate, the specific aims section of a report about healthcare
improvement work should state that both process and outcomes will be
assessed. Focusing only on assessment of outcomes ignores the
possibility that clinicians may not have adopted the desired practice,
or did not adopt it effectively, during the study period. Changing care
delivery is the foundation of improvement work and should also be
measured and reported. In the subsequent methods section, the example
presented here also describes the process measures used to evaluate the
VBS.
