## What to write

A.  Key findings, including relevance to the rationale and specific aims

B.  Particular strengths of the project

## Explanation

Although often not called out with a specific subheading, the 'summary'
of a report on healthcare improvement most often introduces and frames
the 'discussion' section. While the first paragraph should be a focused
summary of the most critical findings, the majority of the project's
results should be contained in the results section. The goal of the
summary is to capture the major findings and bridge the discussion to a
more nuanced exploration of those findings. Exactly where the summary
section ends is far less important that how it sets up the reader to
explore and reflect on the ensuing discussion.

The example below gives a clear and concise statement of the study's
strengths and distinctive features. This summary recaps quantitative
findings (families called METs relatively infrequently and fewer of
their calls resulted in intensive care unit (ICU) transfers), and
introduces a subsequent discussion of concerns identified by families
which might not be visible to clinicians, including ways in which
'family activation of an MET may improve care without reducing
MET-preventable codes outside of the ICU'.[@R44] This conveys an
important message and bridges to a discussion of the existing literature
and terminology. Providing a focused summary in place of an exhaustive
re-statement of project results appropriately introduces the reader to
the discussion section and a more thorough description of the study's
findings and implications.

The authors go on to relate these main findings back to the nature and
significance of the problem and the specific aims previously outlined in
the introduction section, specifically (emphasis added) 'To evaluate the
*burden of family activation* on the clinicians involved\\...too better
understand the *outcome of METs,* and to begin *to understand why
families call METs'.*[@R44]

Another approach in structuring the summary component of the discussion
is to succinctly link results to the relevant processes in the
development of the associated interventions. This approach is
illustrated by Beckett *et al* in a recent paper about decreasing
cardiac arrests in the acute hospital setting,[@R63] "Key to this
success has been the development of a structured response to the
deteriorating patient. Following the implementation of reliable EWS
(early warning systems) across the AAU(Acute Admissions Unit) and ED
(Emergency Department), and the recognition and response checklists,
plus weekly safety meetings in the AAU at SRI(Stirling Royal
Infirmary), there was an immediate fall in the number of cardiac
arrests, which was sustained thereafter."[@R63] This linkage serves to
reintroduce the reader to some of the relevant contextual elements which
can subsequently be discussed in more detail as appropriate.
Importantly, it also serves to frame the interpretive section of the
discussion which focuses on comparison of results with findings from
other publications, and further evaluating the project's impact.

## Example

> In our 6-year experience with family-activated METs(Medical Emergency
> Teams), families uncommonly activated METs. In the most recent and
> highest-volume year, families called 2.3 times per month on average.
> As a way of comparison, the hospital had an average of 8.7 accidental
> code team activations per month over this time. This required an
> urgent response from the larger team. Family activation less commonly
> resulted in ICU transfer than clinician activated METs, although 24%
> of calls did result in transfers. This represents a subset of
> deteriorating patients that the clinical team may have missed. In both
> family-activated and clinician-activated MET calls, clinical
> deterioration was a common cause of MET calls. Families more
> consistently identified their fear that the child's safety was at
> risk, a lack of response from the clinical team, and that the
> interaction between team and family had become dismissive. To our
> knowledge, this study is the largest study of family-activated METs to
> date, both in terms of count of calls and length of time observed. It
> is also the first to compare reasons for MET calls from families with
> matched clinician-activated calls.[@R44]
