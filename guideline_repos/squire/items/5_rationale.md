## What to write

Informal or formal frameworks, models, concepts, and/or theories used to
explain the problem, any reasons or assumptions that were used to
develop the intervention(s), and reasons why the intervention(s) was
expected to work.

## Explanation

The label 'rationale' for this guideline item refers to the reasons the
authors have for expecting that an intervention will 'work.' A rationale
is always present in the heads of researchers; however, it is important
to make this explicit and communicate it in healthcare quality
improvement work. Without this, learning from empirical studies may be
limited and opportunities for accumulating and synthesising knowledge
across studies restricted.[@R8]

Authors can express a rationale in a variety of ways, and in more than
one way in a specific paper. These include providing an explanation,
specifying underlying principles, hypothesising processes or mechanism
of change, or producing a logic model (often in the form of a diagram)
or a programme theory. The rationale may draw on a specific theory with
clear causal links between constructs or on a general framework which
indicates potential mechanisms of change that an intervention could
target.

A well developed rationale allows the possibility of evaluating not just
whether the intervention had an effect, but how it had that effect. This
provides a basis for understanding the mechanisms of action of the
intervention, and how it is likely to vary across, for example,
populations, settings and targets. An explicit rationale leads to
specific hypotheses about mechanisms and/or variation, and testing these
hypotheses provides valuable new knowledge, whether or not they are
supported. This knowledge lays the foundation for optimising the
intervention, accumulating evidence about mechanisms and variation, and
advancing theoretical understanding of interventions in general.

The first example shows how a theory (the 'Fit between Individuals, Task
and Technology' framework) can identify and clarify the social and
technological barriers to healthcare improvement work. The study
investigated engagement with a computerised system to support decisions
about postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: use of the
framework led to 11 distinct barriers being identified, each associated
with a clearly specified intervention which was undertaken.

The second example illustrates the use of an integrative theoretical
framework for intervention development.[@R25] The authors used an
integrative framework rather than a specific theory/model/framework.
This was in order to start with as comprehensive a framework as
possible, since many theories of behaviour change are partial. This
example provides a clear description of the framework and how analysing
the target behaviour using an integrative theoretical model informed the
selection of intervention content.

Interventions may be effective without the effects being brought about
by changes identified in the hypothesised mechanisms; on the other hand,
they may activate the hypothesised mechanisms without changing
behaviour. The knowledge gained through a theory-based evaluation is
essential for understanding processes of change and, hence, for
developing more effective interventions. This paper also cited evidence
for, and examples of, the utility of the framework in other contexts.

## Examples

### Example 1

> The team used a variety of qualitative methods ...to understand
> sociotechnical barriers. At each step of collection, we categorised
> data according to the FITT ('Fit between Individuals, Task, and
> Technology')model criteria ... Each component of the activity system
> (ie, user, task and technology) was clearly defined and each
> interface between components was explored by drawing from several
> epistemological disciplines including the social and cognitive
> sciences. The team designed interventions to address each identified
> FITT barrier....... By striving to understand the barriers affecting
> activity system components and the interfaces between them, we were
> able to develop a plan that addressed user needs, implement an
> intervention that articulated with workflow, study the contextual
> determinants of performance, and act in alignment with stakeholder
> expectations.[@R22]

### Example 2

> ...We describe the development of an intervention to improve
> medication management in multimorbidity by general practitioners
> (GPs), in which we applied the steps of the BCW(Behaviour Change
> Wheel)[@R23] to enable a more transparent implementation of the MRC
> (Medical Research Council) framework for design and evaluation of
> complex interventions....
>
> ...we used the COM-B (capability, opportunity,
> motivation---behaviour) model to develop a theoretical understanding
> of the target behaviour and guide our choice of intervention
> functions. We used the COM-B model to frame our qualitative
> behavioural analysis of the qualitative synthesis and interview data.
> We coded empirical data relevant to GPs' ...capabilities,
> ...opportunities and ...motivations to highlight why GPs were or were
> not engaging in the target behaviour and what needed to change for the
> target behaviour to be achieved.
>
> The BCW incorporates a comprehensive panel of nine intervention
> functions, shown in @fig-bcw,
> which were drawn from a synthesis of 19 frameworks of
> behavioural-intervention strategies. We determined which intervention
> functions would be most likely to effect behavioural change in our
> intervention by mapping the individual components of the COM-B
> behavioural analysis onto the published BCW linkage matrices...[@R24]
