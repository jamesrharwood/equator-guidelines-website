## What to write

Identification as a randomised trial

## Example

"Efficacy and Safety of Early Administration of 4-Factor Prothrombin
Complex Concentrate in Patients With Trauma at Risk of Massive
Transfusion: The PROCOAG Randomized Clinical Trial."[@ref25]

## Explanation

The ability to identify a report of a randomised trial in a
bibliographic database depends to a large extent on how it was indexed.
Indexers might not classify a report as a randomised trial if the
authors do not explicitly report this information.[@ref26] To help
ensure that a study is appropriately indexed and easily identified,
authors should use the word "randomised" in the title to indicate that
the participants were randomly assigned to their comparison groups.
