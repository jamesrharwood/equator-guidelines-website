## What to write

Structured summary of the trial design, methods, results, and conclusions

## Explanation

Transparent and sufficiently detailed abstracts are important because
readers often base their assessment of a trial on such information. Some
readers use an abstract as a screening tool to decide whether to read
the full article. However, not all trials are freely available and some
health professionals and other users do not have access to the full
trial reports.[@ref27]

A journal abstract should contain sufficient information about a trial
to serve as an accurate record of its conduct and findings, providing
optimal information about the trial within the space constraints and
format of a journal. A properly constructed and written abstract helps
individuals to assess quickly the relevance of the findings and aids the
retrieval of relevant reports from electronic databases.[@ref28] The
abstract should accurately reflect what is included in the full journal
article and should not include information that does not appear in the
body of the paper. In addition, abstracts should not be a distorted
representation of the trial results. Studies comparing information
reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the
full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with, or
missing from, the body of the full article.[@ref29; @ref30; @ref31]
[@ref32] Abstracts are also frequently reported with spin defined as a
distorted representation of the study results.[@ref33; @ref34; @ref35]
Authors should avoid selectively reporting only statistically
significant secondary outcomes or subgroup analyses. Conversely,
omitting important harms from the abstract could seriously mislead
interpretation of the trial findings and benefit-to-harms balance that
is critical for decision making.[@ref36; @ref37]

An extension to CONSORT 2001 provided a list of essential items that
authors should include in a journal (or conference) abstract when
reporting the main results of a randomised trial.[@ref38] A systematic
review of 10 meta-research studies examined the reporting quality of
abstracts of randomised trials and found improvements in reporting
following publication of this extension.[@ref39] @tbl-abstract-content provides a list of essential items to
include in an abstract; it is based on the CONSORT for Abstracts
extension[@ref40] and has been updated to reflect changes made to the
main CONSORT checklist. We strongly recommend the use of structured
abstracts for reporting randomised trials. They provide readers with
information about the trial under a series of headings pertaining to the
design, conduct, analysis and interpretation.[@ref41] Some studies have
found that structured abstracts offer greater value and information
coverage than the more traditional descriptive abstracts[@ref42]
[@ref43] and allow readers to find information more easily.[@ref44] We
recognise that journals have their own structure for reporting
abstracts. It is not our intention to suggest changes to these formats,
but to recommend what information should be reported.
