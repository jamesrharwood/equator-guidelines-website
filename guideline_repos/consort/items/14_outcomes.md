## Explanation

All randomised trials assess outcomes, for which the groups are
compared. Most trials have several outcomes, some of which are of more
importance than others. The primary outcome is the prespecified outcome
considered to be of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders (such
as patients, policy makers, clinicians, and funders) and should be the
one used in the sample size calculation (item 16). The primary outcome
should be explicitly indicated as such in the report of a randomised
trial. Other outcomes of interest are secondary outcomes.

It is important to explain the rationale and clinical relevance for
chosen efficacy and harm outcomes, including whether they are part of a
core outcome set.[@ref217; @ref218] A core outcome set is an agreed
standardised set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a
minimum, in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or health
care. The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials)
initiative and COMET database facilitate access to core outcome sets
(<https://www.comet-initiative.org/>).

Most trials have a single primary outcome. Having several primary
outcomes can incur potential problems of interpretation associated with
multiplicity of analyses (items 28 and 30). There are typically multiple
secondary outcomes (ie, the outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol
to assess any additional effects of the intervention). Secondary
outcomes can include harms that may include unintended effects of the
intervention (item 27).

The primary and secondary outcomes reported should be consistent with
the outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol and the registry.
Evidence shows important discrepancies between the outcome reported in
the registry or protocol and outcomes reported in final publications,
frequently in favour of statistically significant results. Any change in
outcome(s) specified in the protocol should be reported, with reasons
(item 10).[@ref51; @ref175; @ref176]

All outcomes, whether primary or secondary, should be described and
completely defined. This information is typically also detailed in the
trial's protocol and the trial registry. The principle here is that the
information provided should be sufficient to allow others to use the
same outcomes.[@ref198] For each outcome, it is important to detail: (1)
the specific measurement variable, which corresponds to the data
collected directly from trial participants (eg, Beck Depression Scale;
all cause mortality) with definition where relevant (eg, major bleeding
was defined as fatal bleeding or symptomatic bleeding in a critical area
or organ; all cause mortality per hospital database); (2) the specific
participant level analysis metric, which corresponds to the format of
the outcome data that was used from each trial participant for analysis
(eg, change from baseline; final value or value at a time point; time to
event); (3) the method of aggregation, which refers to the summary
measure format for each trial group (eg, mean; proportion of
participants with score \>2); and (4) the measurement time point of
interest for analysis.[@ref219] For composite outcomes, all individual
components of the composite outcome should be described as secondary
outcomes.[@ref21] Only half of randomised trials published in PubMed
indexed journals in 2000 and 2006 specified the primary
outcome.[@ref220; @ref221] In recent samples of trials published in
specific fields, reporting has improved but still two thirds did not
provide a complete definition.[@ref222; @ref223]

The use of previously developed and validated scales can help to enhance
quality of measurement.[@ref224; @ref225] For example, assessment of
health related quality of life using a validated instrument is critical
to the integrity and applicability of the trial.[@ref226] Authors should
report measurement properties of outcome measurement instruments to
assist in interpretation and comparison with similar studies.[@ref227]

In most trials, information on outcomes is set to be collected as part
of the trial conduct. However, some trials may use existing data
collecting structures (eg, national, healthcare or administrative
registries). This should be clarified in the methods. There is empirical
evidence that treatment effect estimates may be different in trials
where outcomes are obtained from routinely collected data.[@ref228]
