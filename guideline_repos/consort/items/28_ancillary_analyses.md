## What to write

Any other analyses performed, including subgroup and sensitivity analyses, distinguishing prespecified from post hoc

## Examples

"In a \[prespecified\] sensitivity analysis to support the primary
binary endpoint, the NRS \[numerical rating score\] pain score at 1
month was also analyzed using the constrained longitudinal data analysis
model . . . Primary Outcome: At 1 month after the intervention, the
percentage of responders (Low Back Pain intensity \<40) was higher in
the glucocorticoid intradiscal injection (GCIDI) group (36 of 65
\[55.4%\]) than the control group (21of 63 \[33.3%\]) (absolute risk
difference, 22.1 percent-age points \[CI, 5.5 to 38.7 percentage
points\]; P=0.009 \[after multiple imputation\]) . . . In the
sensitivity analysis, the mean reduction in LBP \[low back pain\]
intensity from baseline to 1 month was greater in the GCIDI group (−32.5
\[CI,-38.2 to −26.8\]) than the control group (−17.5 \[CI, −23.3 to
−11.7\]) (absolute difference, -15.0 \[CI,-22.9 to −7.1\]; P\<
0.001)."[@ref422]

"Owing to the later inclusion of parent cosmetic appearance assessments
(to assist with trial conduct), it was decided to perform a post hoc
subgroup analysis to determine whether the scores given by the assessors
and parents differed between treatment groups \[@tbl-15\] . . . The assessor scores did not
indicate a difference between the nail-replaced and nail-discarded
groups. However, the scores given by the parents suggested that there
was a statistically significant difference in favour of the
nail-discarded group. The treatment by subgroup interaction term was
statistically significant (OR \[odds ratio\] 0.24, 95% CI \[confidence
interval\] 0.06 to 0.96. P= 0.044)."

: Example of good reporting: Main, secondary, and subgroup analyses of Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score cosmetic outcome[@ref479]. Adapted from Jain et al.[@ref479] IQR=interquartile range; OFNAS=Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score. Values in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals; effect sizes are shown as odds ratios, except †probability that OFNAS in discard arm is greater than that in replace arm from Mann-Whitney U test. Adjusted model allowed for intrasite correlation using cluster-robust
standard errors. {#tbl-15}

## Explanation

Multiple analyses of the same data create a risk for false-positive
findings.[@ref480] Authors should especially resist the temptation to
perform many subgroup analyses.[@ref481; @ref482; @ref483] Analyses
that were prespecified in the trial protocol (item 3) are much more
reliable than those suggested by the data, and therefore authors should
report which analyses were prespecified. If subgroup analyses were
undertaken, authors should report which subgroups were examined, why,
whether they were prespecified, and how many were prespecified.
Selective reporting of subgroup analyses could lead to bias.[@ref484]
When evaluating a subgroup, the question is not whether the subgroup
demonstrates a statistically significant result but whether the subgroup
treatment effects are significantly different from each other. To
determine this, a test of interaction is helpful, although the power for
such tests is typically low. If formal evaluations of interaction are
undertaken (item 21d) they should be reported as the estimated
difference in the intervention effect in each subgroup (with a CI), not
just as P values.

In one survey,[@ref481] 35 of 50 trial reports included subgroup
analyses, of which only 42% used tests of interaction. It was often
difficult to determine whether subgroup analyses had been specified in
the protocol. In another survey of surgical trials published in high
impact journals, 27 of 72 trials reported 54 subgroup analyses of which
91% were post hoc and only 6% of subgroup analyses used a test of
interaction to assess whether a subgroup effect existed.[@ref485]
