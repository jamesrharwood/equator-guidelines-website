## What to write

For each group, losses and exclusions after randomisation, together with reasons

## Example

See @fig-2.[@ref421]

## Explanation

Some protocol deviations may be reported in the flow diagram (item 22a),
for example, participants who did not receive the intended intervention.
If participants were excluded after randomisation (contrary to the
intention-to-treat principle) because they were found not to meet
eligibility criteria, they should be included in the flow diagram. Use
of the term "protocol deviation" in published articles is not sufficient
to justify exclusion of participants after randomisation. The nature of
the protocol deviation and the exact reason for excluding participants
after randomisation should always be reported. Similarly, if
participants did not complete the treatment intervention as allocated
(ie, discontinued treatment), this should be reported by trial group,
with reasons.

While attrition as a result of loss to follow-up is often unavoidable,
it is important to report the number of participants who do not complete
follow-up as planned; this should be reported by trial group along with
reasons. For the primary outcome, loss to follow-up can be reported in
the flow diagram.
