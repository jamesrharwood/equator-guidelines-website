## What to write

Concomitant care received during the trial for each group

## Example

"The principal investigators invited hospitals with the capability to
provide the current standard of care for covid-19 to participate in the
study. Minimum requirements for the standard of care included the
provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, regular laboratory
testing, SARS-CoV-2 testing, haemodynamic monitoring, and intensive
care, as well as the ability to deliver concomitant medications . . .

"90 (60%) patients received concomitant drug treatment before
randomisation. Among these, 52 (35%) patients received antiviral
treatment \[@tbl-9\] . . . Concomitant
treatments, including antiviral agents, antibiotics, and systemic
glucocorticoid therapy, were similar in the two groups \[@tbl-9\]."[@ref447]

## Explanation

Concomitant care refers to any additional treatments, interventions, or
medications that participants may have received during the trial period,
in addition to the study interventions. Relevant concomitant care refers
to interventions that could have affected the outcome. Transparently
reporting this information is essential for readers to understand the
context in which the trial was conducted and be able to assess the
potential influence of concomitant care on the trial's results.
Particularly, readers should be aware of any unequal use of concomitant
care that might affect the outcome between the intervention and
comparator groups.[@ref448] This is particularly important when the
trials are not fully blinded.[@ref449] This information could be
particularly important for evaluating the risk of bias due to deviations
from the intended interventions, an important domain of the risk-of-bias
tool developed by Cochrane.[@ref210; @ref211]

Nevertheless, this information is poorly reported. A review of 164
cardiovascular clinical trials published in five influential medical
journals from 2011 to 2021 showed that cointerventions were inadequately
reported in 71% of the trials [@ref450] and that trials with deficient
reporting had larger treatment effect estimates on average.[@ref451] In
rheumatology, an assessment of 109 trials in leading journals from 2018
to 2020 found that only 57% of randomised trials provided the number of
patients on concomitant medications at baseline, and only 5% reported
the cumulative or mean exposure data for concomitant
medications.[@ref452]

Authors should report the number and percentage of participants
receiving the different relevant concomitant care in each arm and, where
relevant, the cumulative or average for each concomitant intervention
taken over the trial period for each group.
