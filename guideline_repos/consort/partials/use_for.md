You can use this reporting guideline if you are writing a report of a trial where participants have been randomly assigned to one or more groups receiving a healthcare treatment or treatments being tested, or to a comparison group (control group) receiving usual care, a placebo, or no treatment.
<!-- #TODO: Break this apart. Reword once RCT is defined -->

You can also use this reporting guideline to:

* write up trials of other types of (non healthcare) interventions if group allocation is randomised. 
<!-- #TODO: Can they? Even if it's not medical at all? E.g. psychological experiment? Metascience study like GoodReports? Will authors need to adapt any items when doing this? -->
* review the _reporting_ of a randomized, controlled trial article, but not for appraising the quality of its design or conduct.
