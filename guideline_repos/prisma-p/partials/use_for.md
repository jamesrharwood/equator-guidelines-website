**Use {{< meta acronym >}} for writing a protocol or plan for a systematic review** describing the rationale, the objectives, the methods you will use to locate, select and critically appraise studies, and to analyse data from the included studies.

<!-- [#TODO: Only for reviews of RCTs? -->

You can also use {{< meta acronym >}} for:

* writing a funding application or an entry for a prospective review register such as [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/)
* reviewing the reporting of a systematic review protocol, but not for appraising the quality of its design.
