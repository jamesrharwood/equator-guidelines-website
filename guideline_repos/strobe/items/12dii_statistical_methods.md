In individually matched case-control studies a crude analysis of the odds ratio, ignoring the matching, usually leads to an estimation that is biased towards unity (see Box 2). A matched analysis is therefore often necessary. This can intuitively be understood as a stratified analysis: each case is seen as one stratum with his or her set of matched controls. The analysis rests on considering whether the case is more often exposed than the controls, despite having made them alike regarding the matching variables. Investigators can do such a stratified analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method on a â€˜matched' 2 by 2 table. In its simplest form the odds ratio becomes the ratio of pairs that are discordant for the exposure variable. If matching was done for variables like age and sex that are universal attributes, the analysis needs not retain the individual, person-to-person matching: a simple analysis in categories of age and sex is sufficient [50]. For other matching variables, such as neighbourhood, sibship, or friendship, however, each matched set should be considered its own stratum.

In individually matched studies, the most widely used method of analysis is conditional logistic regression, in which each case and their controls are considered together. The conditional method is necessary when the number of controls varies among cases, and when, in addition to the matching variables, other variables need to be adjusted for. To allow readers to judge whether the matched design was appropriately taken into account in the analysis, we recommend that authors describe in detail what statistical methods were used to analyse the data. If taking the matching into account does have little effect on the estimates, authors may choose to present an unmatched analysis.

> We used McNemar's test, paired t test, and conditional logistic regression analysis to compare dementia patients with their matched controls for cardiovascular risk factors, the occurrence of spontaneous cerebral emboli, carotid disease, and venous to arterial circulation shunt
