## What to write

Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorised

## Explanation

Categorizing continuous data has several important implications for
analysis (see [{{< meta items.matching-criteria.title >}}]({{< meta items.matching-criteria.web_path >}}#grouping)) and
also affects the presentation of results. In tables, outcomes should be
given for each exposure category, for example as counts of persons at
risk, person-time at risk, if relevant separately for each group (e.g.,
cases and controls). Details of the categories used may aid comparison
of studies and meta-analysis. If data were grouped using conventional
cut-points, such as body mass index thresholds [@pmed-0040297-b162],
group boundaries (i.e., range of values) can be derived easily, except
for the highest and lowest categories. If quantile-derived categories
are used, the category boundaries cannot be inferred from the data. As a
minimum, authors should report the category boundaries; it is helpful
also to report the range of the data and the mean or median values
within categories.
