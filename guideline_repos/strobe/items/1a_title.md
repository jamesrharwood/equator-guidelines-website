## What to write

Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract.

## Explanation

Readers should be able to easily identify the design that was used from the title or abstract. An explicit, commonly used term for the study design also helps ensure correct indexing of articles in electronic databases [@pmed-0040297-b019; @pmed-0040297-b020].
