## What to write

Report the numbers of individuals at each stage of the study—e.g., numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed; Consider use of a flow diagram.

## Explanation

Detailed information on the process of recruiting study participants is
important for several reasons. Those included in a study often differ in
relevant ways from the target population to which results are applied.
This may result in estimates of prevalence or incidence that do not
reflect the experience of the target population. For example, people who
agreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviour attended
church less often, had less conservative sexual attitudes and earlier
age at first sexual intercourse, and were more likely to smoke
cigarettes and drink alcohol than people who refused
[@pmed-0040297-b130]. These differences suggest that postal surveys
may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the population. Such
response bias (see [{{< meta items.bias.title >}}]({{< meta items.bias.web_path >}}#bias))
can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between
those eligible for the study and those included in the study. As another
example, the association between young maternal age and leukaemia in
offspring, which has been observed in some case-control studies
[@pmed-0040297-b131; @pmed-0040297-b132], was explained by
differential participation of young women in case and control groups.
Young women with healthy children were less likely to participate than
those with unhealthy children [@pmed-0040297-b133]. Although low
participation does not necessarily compromise the validity of a study,
transparent information on participation and reasons for
non-participation is essential. Also, as there are no universally agreed
definitions for participation, response or follow-up rates, readers need
to understand how authors calculated such proportions
[@pmed-0040297-b134].

Ideally, investigators should give an account of the numbers of
individuals considered at each stage of recruiting study participants,
from the choice of a target population to the inclusion of
participants' data in the analysis. Depending on the type of study,
this may include the number of individuals considered to be potentially
eligible, the number assessed for eligibility, the number found to be
eligible, the number included in the study, the number examined, the
number followed up and the number included in the analysis. Information
on different sampling units may be required, if sampling of study
participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example
above (multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise that
authors describe the flow of participants separately for case and
control groups [@pmed-0040297-b135]. Controls can sometimes be
selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalised
patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separate
account of the numbers of participants for each type of control group.
Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guidelines for controls
recruited through random-digit dialling and other methods
[@pmed-0040297-b136].

A recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general
epidemiology, public health and medical journals found that some
information regarding participation was provided in 47 of 107
case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154 cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86
cross-sectional studies (59%) [@pmed-0040297-b137]. Incomplete or
absent reporting of participation and non-participation in
epidemiological studies was also documented in two other surveys of the
literature [@pmed-0040297-b004; @pmed-0040297-b005]. Finally, there
is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have
declined in recent decades
[@pmed-0040297-b137; @pmed-0040297-b138], which underscores the
need for transparent reporting [@pmed-0040297-b139].

## Examples

> "Of the 105 freestanding bars and taverns sampled, 13 establishments
were no longer in business and 9 were located in restaurants, leaving 83
eligible businesses. In 22 cases, the owner could not be reached by
telephone despite 6 or more attempts. The owners of 36 bars declined
study participation. (\...) The 25 participating bars and taverns
employed 124 bartenders, with 67 bartenders working at least 1 weekly
daytime shift. Fifty-four of the daytime bartenders (81%) completed
baseline interviews and spirometry; 53 of these subjects (98%) completed
follow-up" [@pmed-0040297-b129].
