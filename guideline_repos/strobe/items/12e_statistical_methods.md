## What to write

Describe any sensitivity analyses.

## Explanation

Sensitivity analyses are useful to investigate whether or not the main
results are consistent with those obtained with alternative analysis
strategies or assumptions [@pmed-0040297-b121]. Issues that may be
examined include the criteria for inclusion in analyses, the definitions
of exposures or outcomes [@pmed-0040297-b122], which confounding
variables merit adjustment, the handling of missing data
[@pmed-0040297-b120; @pmed-0040297-b123], possible selection bias
or bias from inaccurate or inconsistent measurement of exposure, disease
and other variables, and specific analysis choices, such as the
treatment of quantitative variables (see [{{< meta items.quantitative-variables.title >}}]({{< meta items.quantitative-variables.web_path >}})). Sophisticated methods
are increasingly used to simultaneously model the influence of several
biases or assumptions [@pmed-0040297-b124; @pmed-0040297-b125; @pmed-0040297-b126].

In 1959 Cornfield et al. famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for
cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremely unlikely to be due to
any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at
least nine times as prevalent in smokers as in non-smokers
[@pmed-0040297-b127]. This analysis did not rule out the possibility
that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such
a factor would need to have. The same approach was recently used to
identify plausible confounding factors that could explain the
association between childhood leukaemia and living near electric power
lines [@pmed-0040297-b128]. More generally, sensitivity analyses can
be used to identify the degree of confounding, selection bias, or
information bias required to distort an association. One important,
perhaps under recognised, use of sensitivity analysis is when a study
shows little or no association between an exposure and an outcome and it
is plausible that confounding or other biases toward the null are
present.

## Examples

> "Because we had a relatively higher proportion of 'missing' dead
patients with insufficient data (38/148=25.7%) as compared to live
patients (15/437=3.4%) (...), it is possible that this might have biased
the results. We have, therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We
have assumed that the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in
the study group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4% for live
patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios: either all the
exposed missing patients used second generation pills or they all used
third-generation pills" [@pmed-0040297-b120].
