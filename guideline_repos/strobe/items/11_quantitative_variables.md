## What to write

Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, describe which groupings were chosen, and why.

## Explanation

Investigators make choices regarding how to collect and analyse
quantitative data about exposures, effect modifiers and confounders. For
example, they may group a continuous exposure variable to create a new
categorical variable (see [{{< meta items.matching-criteria.title >}}]({{< meta items.matching-criteria.web_path >}}#grouping)). Grouping choices may
have important consequences for later analyses
[@pmed-0040297-b081; @pmed-0040297-b082]. We advise that authors
explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number
of categories, the cut-points, and category mean or median values.
Whenever data are reported in tabular form, the counts of cases,
controls, persons at risk, person-time at risk, etc. should be given for
each category. Tables should not consist solely of effect-measure
estimates or results of model fitting.

Investigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain
all the information. In making this choice, one needs to consider the
nature of the relationship of the exposure to the outcome. As it may be
wrong to assume a linear relation automatically, possible departures
from linearity should be investigated. Authors could mention alternative
models they explored during analyses (e.g., using log transformation,
quadratic terms or spline functions). Several methods exist for fitting
a non-linear relation between the exposure and outcome
[@pmed-0040297-b082; @pmed-0040297-b083; @pmed-0040297-b084]. Also, it may be
informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a
quantitative exposure of prime interest.

In a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological publications studied
quantitative exposure variables [@pmed-0040297-b004]. In 42 of 50
articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories,
but often without any stated rationale for the choices made. Fifteen
articles used linear associations to model continuous exposure but only
two reported checking for linearity. In another survey, of the
psychological literature, dichotomization was justified in only 22 of
110 articles (20%) [@pmed-0040297-b085].

## Examples

> "Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8 are considered to be
seriously injured. A GCS of 9 or more indicates less serious brain
injury. We examined the association of GCS in these two categories with
the occurrence of death within 12 months from injury"
[@pmed-0040297-b080].
