## What to write

Indicate the number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest.

## Explanation

As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors
should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential
confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also
[{{< meta items.statistical-methods-missing-data.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-missing-data.web_path >}}#missing-data)). In a
cohort study, authors should report the extent of loss to follow-up
(with reasons), since incomplete follow-up may bias findings (see also
items [{{< meta items.statistical-methods-loss-to-follow-up.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-loss-to-follow-up.web_path >}}) and [{{< meta items.participants-non-participation.title >}}]({{< meta items.participants-non-participation.web_path >}})) [@pmed-0040297-b148]. We advise authors to use
their tables and figures to enumerate amounts of missing data.
