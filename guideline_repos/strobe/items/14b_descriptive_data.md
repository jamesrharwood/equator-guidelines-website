As missing data may bias or affect generalisability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important characteristics of patients (see also item 12c and Box 6). In a cohort study, authors should report the extent of loss to follow-up (with reasons), since incomplete follow-up may bias findings (see also items 12d and 13) [148]. We advise authors to use their tables and figures to enumerate amounts of missing data.
