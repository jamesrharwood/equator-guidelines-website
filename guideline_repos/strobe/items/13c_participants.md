    text: Consider use of a flow diagram.

## What to write

Consider use of a flow diagram.

## Explanation

An informative and well-structured flow diagram can readily and
transparently convey information that might otherwise require a lengthy
description [@pmed-0040297-b142], as in the example above. The
diagram may usefully include the main results, such as the number of
events for the primary outcome. While we recommend the use of a flow
diagram, particularly for complex observational studies, we do not
propose a specific format for the diagram.
