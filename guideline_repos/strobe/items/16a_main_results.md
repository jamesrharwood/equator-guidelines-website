## What to write

Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (e.g., 95% confidence intervals). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included.

## Explanation

In many situations, authors may present the results of unadjusted or
minimally adjusted analyses and those from fully adjusted analyses. We
advise giving the unadjusted analyses together with the main data, for
example the number of cases and controls that were exposed or not. This
allows the reader to understand the data behind the measures of
association (see also [{{< meta items.outcome-data.title >}}]({{< meta items.outcome-data.web_path >}})). For adjusted analyses, report the number
of persons in the analysis, as this number may differ because of missing
values in covariates (see also [{{< meta items.statistical-methods-missing-data.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-missing-data.web_path >}})). Estimates should be given with
confidence intervals.

Readers can compare unadjusted measures of association with those
adjusted for potential confounders and judge by how much, and in what
direction, they changed. Readers may think that 'adjusted' results
equal the causal part of the measure of association, but adjusted
results are not necessarily free of random sampling error, selection
bias, information bias, or residual confounding (see [{{< meta items.statistical-methods-description.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-description.web_path >}}#confounding)
). Thus, great care
should be exercised when interpreting adjusted results, as the validity
of results often depends crucially on complete knowledge of important
confounders, their precise measurement, and appropriate specification in
the statistical model (see also [{{< meta items.interpretation.title >}}]({{< meta items.interpretation.web_path >}}))
[@pmed-0040297-b157; @pmed-0040297-b158].

Authors should explain all potential confounders considered, and the
criteria for excluding or including variables in statistical models.
Decisions about excluding or including variables should be guided by
knowledge, or explicit assumptions, on causal relations. Inappropriate
decisions may introduce bias, for example by including variables that
are in the causal pathway between exposure and disease (unless the aim
is to asses how much of the effect is carried by the intermediary
variable). If the decision to include a variable in the model was based
on the change in the estimate, it is important to report what change was
considered sufficiently important to justify its inclusion. If a
'backward deletion' or 'forward inclusion' strategy was used to select
confounders, explain that process and give the significance level for
rejecting the null hypothesis of no confounding. Of note, we and others
do not advise selecting confounders based solely on statistical
significance testing
[@pmed-0040297-b147; @pmed-0040297-b159; @pmed-0040297-b160].

Recent studies of the quality of reporting of epidemiological studies
found that confidence intervals were reported in most articles
[@pmed-0040297-b004]. However, few authors explained their choice of
confounding variables [@pmed-0040297-b004; @pmed-0040297-b005].

## Examples

> "We initially considered the following variables as potential
confounders by Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis: (...) The variables
we included in the final logistic regression models were those (...)
that produced a 10% change in the odds ratio after the Mantel-Haenszel
adjustment" [@pmed-0040297-b155].
