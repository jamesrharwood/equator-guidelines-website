## What to write

State specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses.

## Explanation

Objectives are the detailed aims of the study. Well crafted objectives
specify populations, exposures and outcomes, and parameters that will be
estimated. They may be formulated as specific hypotheses or as questions
that the study was designed to address. In some situations objectives
may be less specific, for example, in early discovery phases.
Regardless, the report should clearly reflect the investigators'
intentions. For example, if important subgroups or additional analyses
were not the original aim of the study but arose during data analysis,
they should be described accordingly (see also items [{{< meta items.study-design.title >}}]({{< meta items.study-design.web_path >}}), [{{< meta items.other-analyses.title >}}]({{< meta items.other-analyses.web_path >}}) and [{{< meta items.interpretation.title >}}]({{< meta items.interpretation.web_path >}})).

## Examples

> "Our primary objectives were to 1) determine the prevalence of domestic
violence among female patients presenting to four community-based,
primary care, adult medicine practices that serve patients of diverse
socioeconomic background and 2) identify demographic and clinical
differences between currently abused patients and patients not currently
being abused." [@pmed-0040297-b027].
