## What to write

If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period

## Explanation

The results from studies examining the association between an exposure
and a disease are commonly reported in relative terms, as ratios of
risks, rates or odds (see [{{< meta items.statistical-methods-subgroups-interactions.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-subgroups-interactions.web_path >}}#interaction)
). Relative measures
capture the strength of the association between an exposure and disease.
If the relative risk is a long way from 1 it is less likely that the
association is due to confounding
[@pmed-0040297-b164; @pmed-0040297-b165]. Relative effects or
associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations
than absolute measures, but what often tends to be the case may be
irrelevant in a particular instance. For example, similar relative risks
were obtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men living
in Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite the fact that
the underlying risk of coronary heart disease varies substantially
between these countries [@pmed-0040297-b166; @pmed-0040297-b167].
In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a
constant rate difference than with a constant rate ratio
[@pmed-0040297-b168].

Widely used statistical models, including logistic
[@pmed-0040297-b169] and proportional hazards (Cox) regression
[@pmed-0040297-b170] are based on ratio measures. In these models,
only departures from constancy of ratio effect measures are easily
discerned. Nevertheless, measures which assess departures from
additivity of risk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk from
Interaction (RERI, see [{{< meta items.statistical-methods-subgroups-interactions.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-subgroups-interactions.web_path >}}) and [{{< meta items.statistical-methods-subgroups-interactions.title >}}]({{< meta items.statistical-methods-subgroups-interactions.web_path >}})#interaction), can be estimated in
models based on ratio measures.

In many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is
of greater interest than the relative risk. For example, if the focus is
on adverse effects of a drug, one will want to know the number of
additional cases per unit time of use (e.g., days, weeks, or years). The
example gives the additional number of breast cancer cases per 1000
women who used hormone-replacement therapy for 10 years
[@pmed-0040297-b163]. Measures such as the attributable risk or
population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease
can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably
be presented together with a measure of statistical uncertainty (e.g.,
confidence intervals as in the example). Authors should be aware of the
strong assumptions made in this context, including a causal relationship
between a risk factor and disease (also [see below](#measures-of-association))
[@pmed-0040297-b171]. Because of the semantic ambiguity and
complexities involved, authors should report in detail what methods were
used to calculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used
[@pmed-0040297-b172].

A recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading
medical journals found that in 62% of abstracts of randomised trials
including a ratio measure absolute risks were given, but only in 21% of
abstracts of cohort studies [@pmed-0040297-b173]. A free text search
of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable
risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk
or odds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31 [@pmed-0040297-b174].

### Measures of association, effect and impact {#measures-of-association}

Observational studies may be solely done to describe the magnitude and
distribution of a health problem in the population. They may examine the
number of people who have a disease at a particular time (prevalence),
or that develop a disease over a defined period (incidence). The
incidence may be expressed as the proportion of people developing the
disease (cumulative incidence) or as a rate per person-time of follow-up
(incidence rate). Specific terms are used to describe different
incidences; amongst others, mortality rate, birth rate, attack rate, or
case fatality rate. Similarly, terms like point prevalence and period,
annual or lifetime prevalence are used to describe different types of
prevalence [@pmed-0040297-b030].

Other observational studies address cause-effect relationships. Their
focus is the comparison of the risk, rate or prevalence of the event of
interest between those exposed and those not exposed to the risk factor
under investigation. These studies often estimate a 'relative risk',
which may stand for risk ratios (ratios of cumulative incidences) as
well as rate ratios (ratios of incidence rates). In case-control studies
only a fraction of the source population (the controls) are included.
Results are expressed as the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases
and controls. This odds ratio provides an estimate of the risk or rate
ratio depending on the sampling of cases and controls
[@pmed-0040297-b175; @pmed-0040297-b176]. The prevalence ratio or
prevalence odds ratio from cross-sectional studies may be useful in some
situations [@pmed-0040297-b177].

Expressing results both in relative and absolute terms may often be
helpful. For example, in a study of male British doctors the incidence
rate of death from lung cancer over 50 years of follow-up was 249 per
100,000 per year among smokers, compared to 17 per 100,000 per year
among non-smokers: a rate ratio of 14.6 (249/17)
[@pmed-0040297-b178]. For coronary heart disease (CHD), the
corresponding rates were 1001 and 619 per 100,000 per year, for a rate
ratio of 1.61 (1001/619). The effect of smoking on death appears much
stronger for lung cancer than for CHD. The picture changes when we
consider the absolute effects of smoking. The difference in incidence
rates was 232 per 100,000 per year (249 − 17) for lung cancer and 382
for CHD (1001 − 619). Therefore, among doctors who smoked, smoking was
more likely to cause death from CHD than from lung cancer.

How much of the disease burden in a population could be prevented by
eliminating an exposure? Global estimates have been published for
smoking: according to one study 91% of all lung cancers, 40% of CHD and
33% of all deaths among men in 2000 were attributed to smoking
[@pmed-0040297-b179]. The population attributable fraction is
generally defined as the proportion of cases caused by a particular
exposure, but several concepts (and no unified terminology) exist, and
incorrect approaches to adjust for other factors are sometimes used
[@pmed-0040297-b172; @pmed-0040297-b180]. What are the implications
for reporting? The relative measures emphasise the strength of an
association, and are most useful in etiologic research. If a causal
relationship with an exposure is documented and associations are
interpreted as *effects*, estimates of relative risk may be translated
into suitable measures of absolute risk in order to gauge the possible
impact of public health policies
[@pmed-0040297-b181]. However, authors should be aware of the strong
assumptions made in this context [@pmed-0040297-b171]. Care is
needed in deciding which concept and method is appropriate for a
particular situation.

## Examples

> "10 years' use of HRT \[hormone replacement therapy\] is estimated to
result in five (95% CI 3--7) additional breast cancers per 1000 users of
oestrogen-only preparations and 19 (15--23) additional cancers per 1000
users of oestrogen-progestagen combinations" [@pmed-0040297-b163].
