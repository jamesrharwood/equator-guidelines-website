## What to write

Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based.

## Explanation

Some journals require authors to disclose the presence or absence of
financial and other conflicts of interest
[@pmed-0040297-b100; @pmed-0040297-b218]. Several investigations
show strong associations between the source of funding and the
conclusions of research articles
[@pmed-0040297-b219; @pmed-0040297-b220; @pmed-0040297-b221; @pmed-0040297-b222]. The conclusions in
randomised trials recommended the experimental drug as the drug of
choice much more often (odds ratio 5.3) if the trial was funded by
for-profit organisations, even after adjustment for the effect size
[@pmed-0040297-b223]. Other studies document the influence of the
tobacco and telecommunication industries on the research they funded
[@pmed-0040297-b224; @pmed-0040297-b225; @pmed-0040297-b226; @pmed-0040297-b227]. There are also examples
of undue influence when the sponsor is governmental or a non-profit
organisation.

Authors or funders may have conflicts of interest that influence any of
the following: the design of the study [@pmed-0040297-b228]; choice
of exposures [@pmed-0040297-b228; @pmed-0040297-b229], outcomes
[@pmed-0040297-b230], statistical methods [@pmed-0040297-b231],
and selective publication of outcomes [@pmed-0040297-b230] and
studies [@pmed-0040297-b232]. Consequently, the role of the funders
should be described in detail: in what part of the study they took
direct responsibility (e.g., design, data collection, analysis, drafting
of manuscript, decision to publish) [@pmed-0040297-b100]. Other
sources of undue influence include employers (e.g., university
administrators for academic researchers and government supervisors,
especially political appointees, for government researchers), advisory
committees, litigants, and special interest groups.
