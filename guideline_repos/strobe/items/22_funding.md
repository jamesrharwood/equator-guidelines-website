Some journals require authors to disclose the presence or absence of financial and other conflicts of interest [100,218]. Several investigations show strong associations between the source of funding and the conclusions of research articles [219–222]. The conclusions in randomised trials recommended the experimental drug as the drug of choice much more often (odds ratio 5.3) if the trial was funded by for-profit organisations, even after adjustment for the effect size [223]. Other studies document the influence of the tobacco and telecommunication industries on the research they funded [224–227]. There are also examples of undue influence when the sponsor is governmental or a non-profit organisation.

Authors or funders may have conflicts of interest that influence any of the following: the design of the study [228]; choice of exposures [228,229], outcomes [230], statistical methods [231], and selective publication of outcomes [230] and studies [232]. Consequently, the role of the funders should be described in detail: in what part of the study they took direct responsibility (e.g., design, data collection, analysis, drafting of manuscript, decision to publish) [100]. Other sources of undue influence include employers (e.g., university administrators for academic researchers and government supervisors, especially political appointees, for government researchers), advisory committees, litigants, and special interest groups.
