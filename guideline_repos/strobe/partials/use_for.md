STROBE provides general reporting recommendations for writing up observational studies in epidemiology, including descriptive observational studies and studies that investigate associations between exposures and health outcomes.

STROBE addresses the three main types of observational studies:

* cohort studies (sometimes called ‘follow-up studies' and ‘longitudinal studies'),
* case-control studies; and
* cross-sectional studies (sometimes called ‘prevalence studies').
