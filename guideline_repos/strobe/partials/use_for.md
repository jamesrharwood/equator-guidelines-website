STROBE provides general reporting recommendations for descriptive observational studies and studies that investigate associations between exposures and health outcomes.

STROBE addresses the three main types of observational studies:

* cohort studies (sometimes called ‘follow-up studies' and ‘longitudinal studies'),
* case-control studies; and
* cross-sectional studies (sometimes called ‘prevalence studies').
