## Read More

An informative and well-structured flow diagram can readily and transparently convey information that might otherwise require a lengthy description [142], as in the example above. The diagram may usefully include the main results, such as the number of events for the primary outcome. While we recommend the use of a flow diagram, particularly for complex observational studies, we do not propose a specific format for the diagram
