**Do not** use {{< meta acronym >}} for:

* writing cohort studies (research involving the observation of one or more groups of people over time), use [STROBE cohort](/guidelines/strobe-cohort/index.qmd) instead.
* writing case-control studies (research investigating potential risk factors by comparing groups with and without the disease), use [STROBE case-control](/guidelines/strobe-case-control/index/qmd) instead.
* writing a synthesis of cohort studies, use [MOOSE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-in-epidemiology-a-proposal-for-reporting-meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-in-epidemiology-moose-group/) instead.
* appraising the quality of cohort studies, use an appraisal tool like the [CASP Cohort Study Checklist](https://casp-uk.net/casp-tools-checklists/cohort-study-checklist/) instead.
