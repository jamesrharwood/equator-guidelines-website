In addition to a trial registration number, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum standard list of items to be included in a trial registry in order for a trial to be considered fully registered (www.who.int/ictrp/network/trds/en/index.html). These standards are supported by ICMJE, other journal editors, and jurisdictional legislation.29 30 31 We recommend that the WHO Trial Registration Data Set be included in the protocol to serve as a brief structured summary of the trial. Its inclusion in the protocol can also signal updates for the registry when associated protocol sections are amendedâ€”thereby promoting consistency between information in the protocol and registry.
