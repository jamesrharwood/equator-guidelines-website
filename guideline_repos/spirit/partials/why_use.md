The {{< meta acronym >}} reporting guideline helps authors write protocols for clinical trials that can be understood and used by a wide audience. 

A well-written protocol facilitates an appropriate assessment of scientific, ethical, and safety issues before a trial begins; consistency and rigor of trial conduct; and full appraisal of the conduct and results after trial completion. {{< meta acronym >}} recommends a full description of what is planned; it does not prescribe how to design or conduct a trial.

This page summarises {{< meta acronym >}} and how it can be used. Each guideline item links to more information, examples, and relevant training.
