    title: "10a. Outcomes"
---

List and define all outcomes for which data were sought. Specify whether 
all results that were compatible with each outcome domain in 
each study were sought (for example, for all measures, time 
points, analyses), and, if not, the methods used to decide which 
results to collect.

## Essential elements

-   List and define the outcome domains and time frame of measurement
    for which data were sought.

-   Specify whether all results that were compatible with each outcome
    domain in each study were sought, and, if not, what process was used
    to select results within eligible domains.

-   If any changes were made to the inclusion or definition of the
    outcome domains or to the importance given to them in the review,
    specify the changes, along with a rationale.

-   If any changes were made to the processes used to select results
    within eligible outcome domains, specify the changes, along with a
    rationale.

## Additional elements

-   Consider specifying which outcome domains were considered the most
    important for interpreting the review's conclusions (such as
    "critical" versus "important" outcomes) and provide rationale for
    the labelling (such as "a recent core outcome set identified the
    outcomes labelled 'critical' as being the most important to
    patients").

## Explanation

Defining outcomes in systematic reviews generally
involves specifying outcome domains (such as pain, quality of life,
adverse events such as nausea) and the time frame of measurement (such
as less than six months).[@ref37] Included studies may report multiple
results that are eligible for inclusion within the review outcome
definition.[@ref66] [@ref67] For example, a study may report results for
two measures of pain (such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire and the
Brief Pain Inventory), at two time points (such as four weeks and eight
weeks), all of which are compatible with a review outcome defined as
"pain \<6 months." Multiple results compatible with an outcome domain in
a study might also arise when study investigators report results based
on multiple analysis populations (such as all participants randomised,
all participants receiving a specific amount of treatment), methods for
handling missing data (such as multiple imputation,
last-observation-carried-forward), or methods for handling confounding
(such as adjustment for different covariates).[@ref67] [@ref68] [@ref69]

Reviewers might seek all results that were compatible with each outcome
definition from each study or use a process to select a subset of the
results.[@ref65] [@ref69] Examples of processes to select results
include selecting the outcome definition that (*a*) was most common
across studies, (*b*) the review authors considered "best" according to
a prespecified hierarchy (for example, which prioritises measures
included in a core outcome measurement set), or (*c*) the study
investigators considered most important (such as the study's primary
outcome). It is important to specify the methods that were used to
select the results when multiple results were available so that users
are able to judge the appropriateness of those methods and whether there
is potential for bias in the selection of results.

Reviewers may make changes to the inclusion or definition of the outcome
domains or to the importance given to them in the review (for example,
an outcome listed as "important" in the protocol is considered
"critical" in the review). Providing a rationale for the change allows
readers to assess the legitimacy of the change and whether it has
potential to introduce bias in the review process.[@ref70]

## Example

Note: the following is an abridged version of an example presented in
full in supplementary table S1 on bmj.com.

> "Eligible outcomes were broadly categorised as follows:
> 
> -   Cognitive function
>     -   Global cognitive function
>     -   Domain-specific cognitive function (especially domains that
>         reflect specific alcohol-related neuropathologies, such as
>         psychomotor speed and working memory)
> -   Clinical diagnoses of cognitive impairment
>     -   Mild cognitive impairment (also referred to as mild
>         neurocognitive disorders)
> 
> Any measure of cognitive function was eligible for inclusion. The tests
or diagnostic criteria used in each study should have had evidence of
validity and reliability for the assessment of mild cognitive
impairment, but studies were not excluded on this basis...Results could
be reported as an overall test score that provides a composite measure
across multiple areas of cognitive ability (i.e. global cognitive
function), sub-scales that provide a measure of domain-specific
cognitive function or cognitive abilities (such as processing speed,
memory), or both...Studies with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were
eligible, a time frame chosen to ensure that studies were designed to
examine more persistent effects of alcohol consumption...No restrictions
were placed on the number of points at which the outcome was measured,
but the length of follow-up and number of measurement points (including
a baseline measure of cognition) was considered when interpreting study
findings and in deciding which outcomes were similar enough to combine
for synthesis.
> 
> We anticipated that individual studies would report data for multiple
cognitive outcomes. Specifically, a single study may report results:
> 
> -   For multiple constructs related to cognitive function, for example,
    global cognitive function and cognitive ability on specific domains
    (e.g. memory, attention, problem-solving, language);
> 
> -   Using multiple methods or tools to measure the same or similar
    outcome, for example reporting measures of global cognitive function
    using both the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal
    Cognitive Assessment;
> 
> -   At multiple time points, for example, at 1, 5, and 10 years.
> 
> Where multiple cognition outcomes were reported, we selected one outcome
for inclusion in analyses and for reporting the main outcomes (e.g. for
GRADEing), choosing the result that provided the most complete
information for analysis. Where multiple results remained, we listed all
available outcomes (without results) and asked our content expert to
independently rank these based on relevance to the review question, and
the validity and reliability of the measures used. Measures of global
cognitive function were prioritised, followed by measures of memory,
then executive function. In the circumstance where results from multiple
multivariable models were presented, we extracted associations from the
most fully adjusted model, except in the case where an analysis adjusted
for a possible intermediary along the causal pathway (i.e. post-baseline
measures of prognostic factors (e.g. smoking, drug use,
hypertension))."[@ref176]
