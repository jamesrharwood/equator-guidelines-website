        How did you handle missing summary statistics, or data conversions?

Describe any methods required to prepare the data for presentation or synthesis, such as handling of missing summary statistics or data conversions.

## Essential elements

-   Report any methods required to prepare the data collected from
    studies for presentation or synthesis, such as handling of missing
    summary statistics or data conversions.


## Explanation

Authors may need to prepare the data collected from
studies so that it is suitable for presentation or to be included in a
synthesis. This could involve algebraic manipulation to convert reported
statistics to required statistics (such as converting standard errors to
standard deviations),[@ref89] transforming effect estimates (such as
converting standardised mean differences to odds ratios[@ref93]), or
imputing missing summary data (such as missing standard deviations for
continuous outcomes, intra-cluster correlations in cluster randomised
trials).[@ref94] [@ref95] [@ref96] Reporting the methods required to
prepare the data will allow readers to judge the appropriateness of the
methods used and the assumptions made and aid in attempts to replicate
the synthesis.

## Example

> "We used cluster-adjusted estimates from cluster randomised controlled
trials (c-RCTs) where available. If the studies had not adjusted for
clustering, we attempted to adjust their standard errors using the
methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2019), using an estimate of the intra-cluster
correlation coefficient (ICC) derived from the trial. If the trial did
not report the cluster-adjusted estimated or the ICC, we imputed an ICC
from a similar study included in the review, adjusting if the nature or
size of the clusters was different (e.g. households compared to
classrooms). We assessed any imputed ICCs using sensitivity
analysis."[@ref181]
