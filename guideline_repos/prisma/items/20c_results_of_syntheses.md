    title: 20c. Heterogeneity

    text: |
        Did you investigate causes of variations in the effect size depending on the characteristics of the population (e.g. aged over or under 60) or the intervention (e.g. invasive or non-invasive ventilation), or the quality of the study (e.g. high or low risk of bias)?  

        Was the data suitable for meta-analysis?  If not, you could group the studies a table grouped by dose, or by risk of bias, and describe any observed patterns. Also acknowledge the limitations of the observational nature of your analysis.

        Did you conduct subgroup analyses? If so, report for each analysis the exact p-value for interaction test, as well as, within each subgroup, the summary estimates, their precision (e.g. standard error or 95% confidence/credible interval) and measures of heterogeneity.

        You could also calculate an estimate of the difference between subgroups and its precision.

        Did you conduct a meta-regression? (not advisable for reviews with a small number of studies)
        If so, report the exact p-value for each analysis as well as the regression coefficient and its precision.

        You could also present a meta-regression as a scatter plot with the study effect estimates plotted against the potential effect modifier.

Present results of all investigations of possible causes of heterogeneity among study results.

## Essential elements

-   If investigations of possible causes of heterogeneity were
    conducted:

    -   present results regardless of the statistical significance,
        magnitude, or direction of effect modification.

    -   identify the studies contributing to each subgroup.

    -   report results with due consideration to the observational
        nature of the analysis and risk of confounding due to other
        factors.[@ref109] [@ref144]

-   If subgroup analysis was conducted, report for each analysis the
    exact P value for a test for interaction as well as, within each
    subgroup, the summary estimates, their precision (such as standard
    error or 95% confidence/credible interval) and measures of
    heterogeneity. Results from subgroup analyses might usefully be
    presented graphically (see Fisher et al[@ref121]).

-   If meta-regression was conducted, report for each analysis the exact
    P value for the regression coefficient and its precision.

-   If informal methods (that is, those that do not involve a formal
    statistical test) were used to investigate heterogeneity---which may
    arise particularly when the data are not amenable to
    meta-analysis---describe the results observed. For example, present
    a table that groups study results by dose or overall risk of bias
    and comment on any patterns observed.[@ref116]

## Additional elements

-   If subgroup analysis was conducted, consider presenting the estimate
    for the difference between subgroups and its precision.

-   If meta-regression was conducted, consider presenting a
    meta-regression scatterplot with the study effect estimates plotted
    against the potential effect modifier.[@ref109]

## Explanation

Presenting results from all investigations of
possible causes of heterogeneity among study results is important for
users of reviews and for future research. For users, understanding the
factors that may, and equally, may not, explain variability in the
effect estimates, may inform decision making. Similarly, presenting all
results is important for designing future studies. For example, the
results may help to generate hypotheses about potential modifying
factors that can be tested in future studies, or help identify "active"
intervention ingredients that might be combined and tested in a future
randomised trial. Selective reporting of the results leads to an
incomplete representation of the evidence that risks misdirecting
decision making and future research.

## Example

> "Among the 4 trials that recruited critically ill patients who were and
were not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomization, the
association between corticosteroids and lower mortality was less marked
in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (ratio of odds
ratios (ORs), 4.34 \[95% CI, 1.46-12.91\]; P = 0.008 based on
within-trial estimates combined across trials); however, only 401
patients (120 deaths) contributed to this comparison...All trials
contributed data according to age group and sex. For the association
between corticosteroids and mortality, the OR was 0.69 (95% CI,
0.51-0.93) among 880 patients older than 60 years, the OR was 0.67 (95%
CI, 0.48-0.94) among 821 patients aged 60 years or younger (ratio of
ORs, 1.02 \[95% CI, 0.63-1.65\], P = 0.94), the OR was 0.66 (95% CI,
0.51-0.84) among 1215 men, and the OR was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.43-0.99) among
488 women (ratio of ORs, 1.07 \[95% CI, 0.58-1.98\],
P = 0.84)."[@ref195]
