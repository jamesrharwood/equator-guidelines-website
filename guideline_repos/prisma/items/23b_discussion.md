Discuss any limitations of the evidence included in the review

## Essential elements

-   Discuss any limitations of the evidence included in the review.

## Explanation 

Discussing the completeness, applicability, and
uncertainties in the evidence included in the review should help readers
interpret the findings appropriately. For example, authors might
acknowledge that they identified few eligible studies or studies with a
small number of participants, leading to imprecise estimates; have
concerns about risk of bias in studies or missing results; or identified
studies that only partially or indirectly address the review question,
leading to concerns about their relevance and applicability to
particular patients, settings, or other target audiences. The
assessments of certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence ([item
22]({{< meta items.certainty-of-evidence >}})) can support the discussion of such limitations.

## Example

> "Study populations were young, and few studies measured longitudinal
exposure. The included studies were often limited by selection bias,
recall bias, small sample of marijuana-only smokers, reporting of
outcomes on marijuana users and tobacco users combined, and inadequate
follow-up for the development of cancer...Most studies poorly assessed
exposure, and some studies did not report details on exposure,
preventing meta-analysis for several outcomes."[@ref198]
