Describe the processes used to decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis (such as tabulating the study intervention characteristics and comparing against the planned groups for each synthesis (item [5]({{< meta items.eligibility_criteria.web_path >}}))).

## Essential elements

-   Describe the processes used to decide which studies were eligible
    for each synthesis.

## Explanation

Before undertaking any statistical synthesis (item
[13d]({{< meta items.synthesis_methods_d.web_path >}})), decisions must be made about which studies are eligible for each planned synthesis (item [5]({{< meta items.eligibility_criteria.web_path >}})). 
These decisions will likely involve subjective judgments that could 
alter the result of a synthesis, yet the
processes used and information to support the decisions are often absent
from reviews. Reporting the processes (whether formal or informal) and
any supporting information is recommended for transparency of the
decisions made in grouping studies for synthesis. Structured approaches
may involve the tabulation and coding of the main characteristics of the
populations, interventions, and outcomes.[@ref92] For example, in a
review examining the effects of psychological interventions for smoking
cessation in pregnancy, the main intervention component of each study
was coded as one of the following based on pre-specified criteria:
counselling, health education, feedback, incentive-based interventions,
social support, and exercise.[@ref38] This coding provided the basis for
determining which studies were eligible for each planned synthesis (such
as incentive-based interventions versus usual care). Similar coding
processes can be applied to populations and outcomes.

## Example

> "Given the complexity of the interventions being investigated, we
attempted to categorize the included interventions along four
dimensions: (1) was housing provided to the participants as part of the
intervention; (2) to what degree was the tenants' residence in the
provided housing dependent on, for example, sobriety, treatment
attendance, etc.; (3) if housing was provided, was it segregated from
the larger community, or scattered around the city; and (4) if case
management services were provided as part of the intervention, to what
degree of intensity. We created categories of interventions based on the
above dimensions:
> 
> 1.  Case management only
> 2.  Abstinence-contingent housing
> 3.  Non-abstinence-contingent housing
> 4.  Housing vouchers
> 5.  Residential treatment with case management
> 
> Some of the interventions had multiple components (e.g.
abstinence-contingent housing with case management). These interventions
were categorized according to the main component (the component that the
primary authors emphasized). They were also placed in separate analyses.
We then organized the studies according to which comparison intervention
was used (any of the above interventions, or usual services)."[@ref180]
