        Did you assess the risk of bias due to unreported results?  

        If so, specify the method or existing tool you used and the process you used to reach a judgement of overall risk of bias 

        Did you make any adaptations to the tool?  If so, describe them and why they were needed.  

        Did you develop a new tool to assess risk of bias due to missing results?  If so, describe how it works and make it publicly available.   

        Did more than one reviewer assess the bias due to missing results independently? If so, report how disagreements were resolved.   

        Did you have a process for obtaining missing results from study investigators? 

        Did you use an automation tool?  If so, report how it works, how it was trained, and how you checked its performance.

Describe any methods used to assess risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis (arising from reporting biases)

## Essential elements

-   Specify the methods (tool, graphical, statistical, or other) used to
    assess the risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis
    (arising from reporting biases).

-   If risk of bias due to missing results was assessed using an
    existing tool, specify the methodological components/domains/items
    of the tool, and the process used to reach a judgment of overall
    risk of bias.

-   If any adaptations to an existing tool to assess risk of bias due to
    missing results were made (such as omitting or modifying items),
    specify the adaptations.

-   If a new tool to assess risk of bias due to missing results was
    developed for use in the review, describe the content of the tool
    and make it publicly accessible.

-   Report how many reviewers assessed risk of bias due to missing
    results in a synthesis, whether multiple reviewers worked
    independently, and any processes used to resolve disagreements
    between assessors.

-   Report any processes used to obtain or confirm relevant information
    from study investigators.

-   If an automation tool was used to assess risk of bias due to missing
    results, report how the tool was used, how the tool was trained, and
    details on the tool's performance and internal validation.

## Explanation 

The validity of a synthesis may be threatened when
the available results differ systematically from the missing results.
This is known as "bias due to missing results" and arises from
"reporting biases" such as selective non-publication and selective
non-reporting of results (see [item 11 â€“ risk of bias assessment]({{< meta items.risk-of-bias-in-individual-studies.web_path >}})#risk-of-bias).[@ref81] Direct methods for assessing
the risk of bias due to missing results include comparing outcomes and
analyses pre-specified in study registers, protocols, and statistical
analysis plans with results that were available in study reports.
Statistical and graphical methods exist to assess whether the observed
data suggest potential for missing results (such as contour enhanced
funnel plots, Egger's test) and how robust the synthesis is to different
assumptions about the nature of potentially missing results (such as
selection models).[@ref84] [@ref122] [@ref123] [@ref124] Tools (such as
checklists, scales, or domain-based tools) that prompt users to consider
some or all of these approaches are available.[@ref81] [@ref84]
Therefore, reporting methods (tools, graphical, statistical, or other)
used to assess risk of bias due to missing results is recommended so
that readers are able to assess how appropriate the methods were. The
process by which assessments were conducted should also be reported to
enable readers to assess the potential for errors and facilitate
replicability.

## Example

> "To assess small-study effects, we planned to generate funnel plots for
meta-analyses including at least 10 trials of varying size. If asymmetry
in the funnel plot was detected, we planned to review the
characteristics of the trials to assess whether the asymmetry was likely
due to publication bias or other factors such as methodological or
clinical heterogeneity of the trials. To assess outcome reporting bias,
we compared the outcomes specified in trial protocols with the outcomes
reported in the corresponding trial publications; if trial protocols
were unavailable, we compared the outcomes reported in the methods and
results sections of the trial publications."[@ref187]
