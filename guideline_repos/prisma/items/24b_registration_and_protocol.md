Indicate where the review protocol can be accessed, or state that a protocol was not prepared

## Essential elements

-   Indicate where the review protocol can be accessed (such as by
    providing a citation, DOI, or link) or state that a protocol was not
    prepared.

## Explanation

The review protocol may contain information about the
methods that is not provided in the final review report (see [box
6](#box6){ref-type="boxed-text"}). Providing a citation, DOI, or link to
the review protocol allows readers to locate the protocol more easily.
Comparison of the methods pre-specified in the review protocol with what
was eventually done allows readers to assess whether any deviations may
have introduced bias.[@ref155] If the review protocol was not published
or deposited in a public repository, or uploaded as a supplementary file
to the review report, we recommend providing the contact details of the
author responsible for sharing the protocol. If authors did not prepare
a review protocol, or prepared one but are not willing to make it
accessible, this should be stated to prevent users spending time trying
to locate the document.

## Example

> "...this systematic review and meta-analysis protocol has been published
elsewhere \[citation for the protocol provided\]."[@ref202]
