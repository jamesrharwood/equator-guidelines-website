        Did you have a method to collect data from each report?  

        Did you have more than one reviewer collecting data from each report?  If so, did they work independently or together? If they worked independently, report how they resolved differences.  

        Did you have a process for contacting study investigators to obtain or confirm relevant data?  

        Did you use any automation tools to collect data? If so, report how the tools works, how it was trained, and what steps were taken to avoid and check for incorrect extractions. 

        Did you use software to extract data from figures?  If so, specify which. 

        Did you translate any of the articles to help with data extraction?  If so report how the articles were translated. 

        Did you use any decision rules to select data from multiple reports of the same study, and to resolve inconsistencies between different reports?  If so, report the rules and steps.

Specify the methods used to collect data from reports, including how many reviewers collected data from each report, whether they worked independently, any processes for obtaining or confirming data from study investigators, and, if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process

## Essential elements

-   Report how many reviewers collected data from each report, whether
    multiple reviewers worked independently or not (for example, data
    collected by one reviewer and checked by another),[@ref60] and any
    processes used to resolve disagreements between data collectors.

-   Report any processes used to obtain or confirm relevant data from
    study investigators (such as how they were contacted, what data were
    sought, and success in obtaining the necessary information).

-   If any automation tools were used to collect data, report how the
    tool was used (such as machine learning models to extract sentences
    from articles relevant to the PICO characteristics),[@ref61]
    [@ref62] how the tool was trained, and what internal or external
    validation was done to understand the risk of incorrect extractions.

-   If articles required translation into another language to enable
    data collection, report how these articles were translated (for
    example, by asking a native speaker or by using software
    programs).[@ref63]

-   If any software was used to extract data from figures,[@ref64]
    specify the software used.

-   If any decision rules were used to select data from multiple reports
    corresponding to a study, and any steps were taken to resolve
    inconsistencies across reports, report the rules and steps
    used.[@ref65]

## Explanation

Authors should report the methods used to collect
data from reports of included studies, to enable readers to assess the
potential for errors in the data presented.[@ref57] [@ref58] [@ref59]

<!-- #ASK this feels like a weak justification considering how much info you are asking for. -->

## Example

"We designed a data extraction form based on that used by Lumley 2009,
which two review authors (RC and TC) used to extract data from eligible
studies. Extracted data were compared, with any discrepancies being
resolved through discussion. RC entered data into Review Manager 5
software (Review Manager 2014), double checking this for accuracy. When
information regarding any of the above was unclear, we contacted authors
of the reports to provide further details."[@ref175]
