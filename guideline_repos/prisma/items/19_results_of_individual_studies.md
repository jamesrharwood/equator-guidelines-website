For all outcomes, present for each study (*a*) summary statistics for each group (where appropriate) and (*b*) an effect estimate and its precision (such as confidence/credible interval), ideally using structured tables or plots

## Essential elements

-   For all outcomes, irrespective of whether statistical synthesis was
    undertaken, present for each study summary statistics for each group
    (where appropriate). For dichotomous outcomes, report the number of
    participants with and without the events for each group; or the
    number with the event and the total for each group (such as 12/45).
    For continuous outcomes, report the mean, standard deviation, and
    sample size of each group.

-   For all outcomes, irrespective of whether statistical synthesis was
    undertaken, present for each study an effect estimate and its
    precision (such as standard error or 95% confidence/credible
    interval). For example, for time-to-event outcomes, present a hazard
    ratio and its confidence interval.

-   If study-level data are presented visually or reported in the text
    (or both), also present a tabular display of the results.

-   If results were obtained from multiple sources (such as journal
    article, study register entry, clinical study report, correspondence
    with authors), report the source of the data. This need not be
    overly burdensome. For example, a statement indicating that, unless
    otherwise specified, all data came from the primary reference for
    each included study would suffice. Alternatively, this could be
    achieved by, for example, presenting the origin of each data point
    in footnotes, in a column of the data table, or as a hyperlink to
    relevant text highlighted in reports (such as using SRDR Data
    Abstraction Assistant[@ref139]).

-   If applicable, indicate which results were not reported directly and
    had to be computed or estimated from other information (see item
    #13b).

## Explanation

Presenting data from individual studies facilitates
understanding of each study's contribution to the findings and reuse of
the data by others seeking to perform additional analyses or perform an
update of the review. There are different ways of presenting results of
individual studies (such as table, forest plot).[@ref28] [@ref115]
Visual display of results supports interpretation by readers, while
tabulation of the results makes it easier for others to reuse the data.

Displaying summary statistics by group is helpful, because it allows an
assessment of the severity of the problem in the studies (such as level
of depression symptoms), which is not available from between-group
results (that is, effect estimates).[@ref137] However, there are some
scenarios where presentation of simple summary statistics for each group
may be misleading. For example, in the case of cluster-randomised
designs, the observed number of events and sample size in each group
does not reflect the effective sample size (that is, the sample size
adjusted for correlation among observations). However, providing the
estimated proportion of events (or another summary statistic) per group
will be helpful.[@ref138] The effect estimates from models that
appropriately adjust for clustering (and other design features) should
be reported and included in the meta-analysis in such instances.
