Provide an explicit statement of the objective(s) or question(s) the review addresses

## Essential elements

-   Provide an explicit statement of all objective(s) or question(s) the
    review addresses, expressed in terms of a relevant question
    formulation framework (see Booth et al[@ref33] and Munn et
    al[@ref34] for various frameworks).

-   If the purpose is to evaluate the effects of interventions, use the
    Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework or
    one of its variants to state the comparisons that will be made.


## Explanation

An explicit and concise statement of the review
objective(s) or question(s) will help readers understand the scope of
the review and assess whether the methods used in the review (such as
eligibility criteria, search methods, data items, and the comparisons
used in the synthesis) adequately address the objective(s). Such
statements may be written in the form of objectives ("the objectives of
the review were to examine the effects of...") or as questions ("what
are the effects of...?").[@ref31]

## Example

"Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of down‐titration (dose
reduction, discontinuation, or disease activity‐guided dose tapering) of
anti‐tumour necrosis factor-blocking agents (adalimumab, certolizumab
pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) on disease activity,
functioning, costs, safety, and radiographic damage compared with usual
care in people with rheumatoid arthritis and low disease
activity."[@ref170]
