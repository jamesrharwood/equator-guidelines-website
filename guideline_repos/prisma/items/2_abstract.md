checklist: Include all items from the _PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts_ checklist.

## Essential elements

Report an abstract addressing each item in the PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts checklist:

<!-- #ASK: is PRISMA for Abstracts published elsewhere? This makes me assume it is. If not, why bother referring to this sublist as a separate thing?  -->

1. Identify the report as a systematic review

2. Provide an explicit statement of the main objective(s) or
    question(s) the review addresses

3. Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review

4. Specify the information sources (such as databases, registers) used
    to identify studies and the date when each was last searched

5. Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included
    studies

6. Specify the methods used to present and synthesise results

7. Give the total number of included studies and participants and
    summarise relevant characteristics of studies

8. Present results for main outcomes, preferably indicating the number
    of included studies and participants for each. If meta-analysis was
    done, report the summary estimate and confidence/credible interval.
    If comparing groups, indicate the direction of the effect (that is,
    which group is favoured)

9. Provide a brief summary of the limitations of the evidence included
    in the review (such as study risk of bias, inconsistency, and
    imprecision)

10. Provide a general interpretation of the results and important
    implications

11. Specify the primary source of funding for the review

12. Provide the register name and registration number

## Explanation:

An abstract providing key information about the main
objective(s) or question(s) that the review addresses, methods, results,
and implications of the findings should help readers decide whether to
access the full report.[@ref29] For some readers, the abstract may be
all that they have access to. Therefore, it is critical that results are
presented for all main outcomes for the main review objective(s) or
question(s) regardless of the statistical significance, magnitude, or
direction of effect. Terms presented in the abstract will be used to
index the systematic review in bibliographic databases. Therefore,
reporting keywords that accurately describe the review question (such as
population, interventions, outcomes) is recommended.

## The PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts checklist

The PRISMA 2020 for Abstracts checklist retains the same items as those
included in the PRISMA for Abstracts statement published in 2013[@ref29]
but has been revised to make the wording consistent with the PRISMA 2020
statement and includes a new item recommending authors specify the
methods used to present and synthesize results (item #6). 

## Example

> "Title: Psychological interventions for common mental disorders in women
> experiencing intimate partner violence in low-income and middle-income
> countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
> 
> Background: Evidence on the effectiveness of psychological interventions
> for women with common mental disorders (CMDs) who also experience
> intimate partner violence is scarce. We aimed to test our hypothesis
> that exposure to intimate partner violence would reduce intervention
> effectiveness for CMDs in low-income and middle-income countries
> (LMICs).
> 
> Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched
> MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS,
> ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google
> Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published
> between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All randomised controlled
> trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which
> measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or
> date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished
> aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate
> partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for
> anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
> psychological distress outcomes. Evidence from randomised controlled
> trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean
> differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and
> who did not report intimate partner violence via random-effects
> meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the
> Cochrane risk of bias tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO, number
> CRD42017078611.
> 
> Findings: Of 8122 records identified, 21 were eligible and data were
> available for 15 RCTs, all of which had a low to moderate risk of
> overall bias. Anxiety (five interventions, 728 participants) showed a
> greater response to intervention among women reporting intimate partner
> violence than among those who did not (difference in standardised mean
> differences \[dSMD\] 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, I^2^=49.4%). No
> differences in response to intervention were seen in women reporting
> intimate partner violence for PTSD (eight interventions, n=1436; dSMD
> 0.14, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.33, I^2^=42.6%), depression (12 interventions,
> n=2940; 0.10, −0.04 to 0.25, I^2^=49.3%), and psychological distress
> (four interventions, n=1591; 0.07, −0.05 to 0.18, I^2^=0.0%, p=0.681).
> 
> Interpretation: Psychological interventions treat anxiety effectively in
> women with current or recent intimate partner violence exposure in LMICs
> when delivered by appropriately trained and supervised health-care
> staff, even when not tailored for this population or targeting intimate
> partner violence directly. Future research should investigate whether
> adapting evidence-based psychological interventions for CMDs to address
> intimate partner violence enhances their acceptability, feasibility, and
> effectiveness in LMICs.
