        Did you investigate potential causes of statistical heterogeneity?  If so, report whether you used subgroup analysis or meta-regression 

        Which factors did you explore?  

        What were the levels of those factors?  

        Which direction did you expect the effect modification to go in and why?  

        Were you able to conduct these analyses at study level – ie. where each study is included in one subgroup only) 

        Did you conduct within-study contrasts to compare subsets of participants from different studies in more than one subgroup? 

        How did you compare subgroup effects statistically?   

        If the data was not suitable for meta-analysis of effect estimates, did you use another method to investigate statistical heterogeneity? For example, you could use structured tables to view variation in results across study sub-populations.   

        Did you pre-specify the ways you were going to investigate heterogeneity or decide after you had collected the data?  Report which investigations were pre-specified and which were decided on later

Describe any methods used to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results (such as subgroup analysis, meta-regression).

## Essential elements

-   If methods were used to explore possible causes of statistical
    heterogeneity, specify the method used (such as subgroup analysis,
    meta-regression).

-   If subgroup analysis or meta-regression was performed, specify for
    each:

    -   which factors were explored, levels of those factors, and which
        direction of effect modification was expected and why (where
        possible).

    -   whether analyses were conducted using study-level variables
        (where each study is included in one subgroup only),
        within-study contrasts (where data on subsets of participants
        within a study are available, allowing the study to be included
        in more than one subgroup), or some combination of the
        above.[@ref121]

    -   how subgroup effects were compared (such as statistical test for
        interaction for subgroup analyses[@ref103]).

-   If other methods were used to explore heterogeneity because data
    were not amenable to meta-analysis of effect estimates, describe the
    methods used (such as structuring tables to examine variation in
    results across studies based on subpopulation, key intervention
    components, or contextual factors) along with the factors and
    levels.[@ref28] [@ref116]

-   If any analyses used to explore heterogeneity were not
    pre-specified, identify them as such.

## Explanation

If authors used methods to explore possible causes of
variation of results across studies (that is, statistical heterogeneity)
such as subgroup analysis or meta-regression (see item [13d, meta-analysis]({{< meta items.synthesis-methods-synthesis-methods.web_path >}}#meta-analysis)), they should provide sufficient
details so that readers are able to assess the appropriateness of the
selected methods and could reproduce the reported results (with access
to the data). Such methods might be used to explore whether, for
example, participant or intervention characteristics or risk of bias of
the included studies explain variation in results.

## Example

> "Given a sufficient number of trials, we used unadjusted and adjusted
mixed-effects meta-regression analyses to assess whether variation among
studies in smoking cessation effect size was moderated by tailoring of
the intervention for disadvantaged groups. The resulting regression
coefficient indicates how the outcome variable (log risk ratio (RR) for
smoking cessation) changes when interventions take a
socioeconomic-position-tailored versus non-socioeconomic-tailored
approach. A statistically significant (p\<0.05) coefficient indicates
that there is a linear association between the effect estimate for
smoking cessation and the explanatory variable. More moderators
(study-level variables) can be included in the model, which might
account for part of the heterogeneity in the true effects. We
pre-planned an adjusted model to include important study covariates
related to the intensity and delivery of the intervention (number of
sessions delivered (above median vs below median), whether interventions
involved a trained smoking cessation specialist (yes vs no), and use of
pharmacotherapy in the intervention group (yes vs no). These covariates
were included a priori as potential confounders given that programmes
tailored to socioeconomic position might include more intervention
sessions or components or be delivered by different professionals with
varying experience. The regression coefficient estimates how the
intervention effect in the socioeconomic-position-tailored subgroup
differs from the reference group of non-socioeconomic-position-tailored
interventions."[@ref185]
