    text: |
        Use a table to summarize the evidence for each of your primary outcome measures.  Make sure you report the level of certainty you have for each 

        Have you made it clear what your reasons were for rating levels of certainty up or down?  Giving explanations in footnotes to evidence summary tables (such as GRADE Summary of Findings tables) is not sufficient. Reasons for your conclusions about the certainty of the evidence should also be given preferably in laymanâ€™s terms in a plain language summary, in the abstract and results sections and in the discussion and conclusion sections.

Present assessments of certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for each outcome assessed

## Essential elements

-   Report the overall level of certainty in the body of evidence (such
    as high, moderate, low, or very low) for each important outcome.

-   Provide an explanation of reasons for rating down (or rating up) the
    certainty of evidence (such as in footnotes to an evidence summary
    table). Explanations for each judgment should be concise,
    informative, relevant to the target audience, easy to understand,
    and accurate (that is, addressing criteria specified in the methods
    guidance).[@ref148]

-   Communicate certainty in the evidence wherever results are reported
    (that is, abstract, evidence summary tables, results, conclusions).
    Use a format appropriate for the section of the review. For example,
    in text, certainty might be reported explicitly in a sentence (such
    as "Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) indicates
    that...") or in brackets alongside an effect estimate (such as "\[RR
    1.17, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.68; 4 studies, 1781 participants; moderate
    certainty evidence\]"). When interpreting results in "summary of
    findings" tables or conclusions, certainty might be communicated
    implicitly using standard phrases (such as "Hip protectors probably
    reduce the risk of hip fracture slightly").[@ref130]

## Additional elements

-   Consider including evidence summary tables, such as GRADE Summary of
    Findings tables.

## Explanation

An important feature of systems for assessing
certainty, such as GRADE, is explicit reporting of both the level of
certainty (or confidence) in the evidence and the basis for
judgments.[@ref97] [@ref98] [@ref127] Evidence summary tables, such as
GRADE Summary of Findings tables, are an effective and efficient way to
report assessments of the certainty of evidence.[@ref97] [@ref127]

## Example

> "Compared with non-operative treatment, low-certainty evidence indicates
surgery (repair with subacromial decompression) may have little or no
effect on function at 12 months. The evidence was downgraded two steps,
once for bias and once for imprecision---the 95% CIs overlap minimal
important difference in favour of surgery at this time point." A summary
of findings table presents the same information as the text above, with
footnotes explaining judgments.[@ref187]
