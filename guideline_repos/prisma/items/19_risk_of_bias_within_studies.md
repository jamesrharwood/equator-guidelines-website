Present data on risk of bias of each study and, if available, any outcome-level assessment (see Item 12).

We recommend that reviewers assess the risk of bias in the included studies using a standard approach with defined criteria (see Item 12). They should report the results of any such assessments [89].

Reporting only summary data (e.g., “two of eight trials adequately concealed allocation”) is inadequate because it fails to inform readers which studies had the particular methodological shortcoming. A more informative approach is to explicitly report the methodological features evaluated for each study. The Cochrane Collaboration's new tool for assessing the risk of bias also requests that authors substantiate these assessments with any relevant text from the original studies [11]. It is often easiest to provide these data in a tabular format, as in the example. However, a narrative summary describing the tabular data can also be helpful for readers.
