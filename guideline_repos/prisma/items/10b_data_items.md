    title: "10b. Other Variables"
---

List and define all other variables for which data were sought (such as participant and intervention characteristics, funding sources). Describe any assumptions made about any missing or unclear information

## Essential elements

-   List and define all other variables for which data were sought. It
    may be sufficient to report a brief summary of information collected
    if the data collection and dictionary forms are made available (for
    example, as additional files or deposited in a publicly available
    repository).

-   Describe any assumptions made about any missing or unclear
    information from the studies. For example, in a study that includes
    "children and adolescents," for which the investigators did not
    specify the age range, authors might assume that the oldest
    participants would be 18 years, based on what was observed in
    similar studies included in the review, and should report that
    assumption.

-   If a tool was used to inform which data items to collect (such as
    the Tool for Addressing Conflicts of Interest in Trials
    (TACIT)[@ref71] [@ref72] or a tool for recording intervention
    details[@ref73] [@ref74] [@ref75]), cite the tool used.

## Explanation

Authors should report the data and information
collected from the studies so that readers can understand the type of
the information sought and to inform data collection in other similar
reviews. Variables of interest might include characteristics of the
study (such as countries, settings, number of centres, funding sources,
registration status), characteristics of the study design (such as
randomised or non-randomised), characteristics of participants (such as
age, sex, socioeconomic status), number of participants enrolled and
included in analyses, the results (such as summary statistics, estimates
of effect and measures of precision, factors adjusted for in analyses),
and competing interests of study authors. For reviews of interventions,
authors may also collect data on characteristics of the interventions
(such as what interventions and comparators were delivered, how they
were delivered, by whom, where, and for how long).

## Example

> "We collected data on:
> 
> -   the report: author, year, and source of publication;
> -   the study: sample characteristics, social demography, and definition
>     and criteria used for depression;
> -   the participants: stroke sequence (first ever vs recurrent), social
>     situation, time elapsed since stroke onset, history of psychiatric
>     illness, current neurological status, current treatment for
>     depression, and history of coronary artery disease;
> -   the research design and features: sampling mechanism, treatment
>     assignment mechanism, adherence, non‐response, and length of follow
>     up;
> -   the intervention: type, duration, dose, timing, and mode of
>     delivery."[@ref177]
