    title: 20a. Summary of studies
---

For each synthesis, briefly summarise the characteristics and risk of bias among contributing studies.

## Essential elements

-   Provide a brief summary of the characteristics and risk of bias
    among studies contributing to each synthesis (meta-analysis or
    other). The summary should focus only on study characteristics that
    help in interpreting the results (especially those that suggest the
    evidence addresses only a restricted part of the review question, or
    indirectly addresses the question). If the same set of studies
    contribute to more than one synthesis, or if the same risk of bias
    issues are relevant across studies for different syntheses, such a
    summary need be provided once only.

-   Indicate which studies were included in each synthesis (such as by
    listing each study in a forest plot or table or citing studies in
    the text).

## Explanation 

Many systematic review reports include narrative
summaries of the characteristics and risk of bias across all included
studies.[@ref36] However, such general summaries are not useful when the
studies contributing to each synthesis vary, and particularly when there
are many studies. For example, one meta-analysis might include three
studies of participants aged 30 years on average, whereas another
meta-analysis might include 10 studies of participants aged 60 years on
average; in this case, knowing the mean age per synthesis is more
meaningful than the overall mean age across all 13 studies. Providing a
brief summary of the characteristics and risk of bias among studies
contributing to each synthesis (meta-analysis or other) should help
readers understand the applicability and risk of bias in the synthesised
result. Furthermore, a summary at the level of the synthesis is more
usable since it obviates the need for readers to refer to multiple
sections of the review in order to interpret results.[@ref92]

## Example

> "Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly compared delirium
incidence between haloperidol and placebo groups \[9 studies cited\].
These RCTs enrolled 3,408 patients in both surgical and medical
intensive care and non-intensive care unit settings and used a variety
of validated delirium detection instruments. Five of the trials were low
risk of bias \[5 studies cited\], three had unclear risk of bias \[3
studies cited\], and one had high risk of bias owing to lack of blinding
and allocation concealment \[1 study cited\]. Intravenous haloperidol
was administered in all except two trials; in those two exceptions, oral
doses were given \[two studies cited\]. These nine trials were pooled,
as they each identified new onset of delirium (incidence) within the
week after exposure to prophylactic haloperidol or placebo."[@ref193]
