    title: 13f. Sensitivitiy analyses
---

Describe any sensitivity analyses conducted to assess robustness of the synthesised results.

## Essential elements

-   If sensitivity analyses were performed, provide details of each
    analysis (such as removal of studies at high risk of bias, use of an
    alternative meta-analysis model).

-   If any sensitivity analyses were not pre-specified, identify them as
    such.

## Explanation

If authors performed sensitivity analyses to assess
robustness of the synthesised results to decisions made during the
review process (see item [13d, meta-analysis]({{< meta items.synthesis_methods_d.web_path >}}#meta-analysis)), they should
provide sufficient details so that readers are able to assess the
appropriateness of the analyses and could reproduce the reported results
(with access to the data). Ideally, sensitivity analyses should be
pre-specified in the protocol, but unexpected issues may emerge during
the review process that necessitate their use.

## Example 

> "We conducted sensitivity meta-analyses restricted to trials with recent
publication (2000 or later); overall low risk of bias (low risk of bias
in all seven criteria); and enrolment of generally healthy women (rather
than those with a specific clinical diagnosis). To incorporate trials
with zero events in both intervention and control arms (which are
automatically dropped from analyses of pooled relative risks), we also
did sensitivity analyses for dichotomous outcomes in which we added a
continuity correction of 0.5 to zero cells."[@ref186]
