Give results of additional analyses, if done (e.g., sensitivity or subgroup analyses, meta-regression [see Item 16]).

Authors should report any subgroup or sensitivity analyses and whether or not they were pre-specified (see Items 5 and 16). For analyses comparing subgroups of studies (e.g., separating studies of low- and high-dose aspirin), the authors should report any tests for interactions, as well as estimates and confidence intervals from meta-analyses within each subgroup. Similarly, meta-regression results (see Item 16) should not be limited to p-values, but should include effect sizes and confidence intervals [150], as the first example reported above does in a table. The amount of data included in each additional analysis should be specified if different from that considered in the main analyses. This information is especially relevant for sensitivity analyses that exclude some studies; for example, those with high risk of bias.

Importantly, all additional analyses conducted should be reported, not just those that were statistically significant. This information will help avoid selective outcome reporting bias within the review as has been demonstrated in reports of randomized controlled trials [42],[44],[121],[151],[152]. Results from exploratory subgroup or sensitivity analyses should be interpreted cautiously, bearing in mind the potential for multiple analyses to mislead.

## Examples

> …benefits of chondroitin were smaller in trials with adequate concealment of allocation compared with trials with unclear concealment (P for interaction = 0.050), in trials with an intention-to-treat analysis compared with those that had excluded patients from the analysis (P for interaction = 0.017), and in large compared with small trials (P for interaction = 0.022).

> Subgroup analyses according to antibody status, antiviral medications, organ transplanted, treatment duration, use of antilymphocyte therapy, time to outcome assessment, study quality and other aspects of study design did not demonstrate any differences in treatment effects. Multivariate meta-regression showed no significant difference in CMV [cytomegalovirus] disease after allowing for potential confounding or effect-modification by prophylactic drug used, organ transplanted or recipient serostatus in CMV positive recipients and CMV negative recipients of CMV positive donors.
