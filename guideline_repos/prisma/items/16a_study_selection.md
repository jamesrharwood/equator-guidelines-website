        Make sure you report the results of the search and study selection process clearly, preferably using a flow diagram.  It should include the number of: records identified; records excluded before screening; records screened; records excluded after screening titles or titles and abstracts; reports retrieved for detailed evaluation; potentially eligible reports that were not retrievable; retrieved reports that did not meet inclusion criteria and the primary reasons for exclusion; and the number of studies and reports included in the review. If applicable, also report the number of ongoing studies and associated reports identified. 

        Is the review an update of a previous review?  If so, report results of the search and selection process for the current review and also the number of studies included in the previous review and how they were selected. 

        Did you use automation tools?  If so, make it clear in the flow diagram how many records were excluded by a human and how many by automation tools.

Describe the results of the search and selection process, from the number of records identified in the search to the number of studies included in the review, ideally using a flow diagram (see @fig-prisma-flow-diagram)

## Essential elements

-   Report, ideally using a flow diagram, the number of: records
    identified; records excluded before screening (for example, because
    they were duplicates or deemed ineligible by machine classifiers);
    records screened; records excluded after screening titles or titles
    and abstracts; reports retrieved for detailed evaluation;
    potentially eligible reports that were not retrievable; retrieved
    reports that did not meet inclusion criteria and the primary reasons
    for exclusion (such as ineligible study design, ineligible
    population); and the number of studies and reports included in the
    review. If applicable, authors should also report the number of
    ongoing studies and associated reports identified.

-   If the review is an update of a previous review, report results of
    the search and selection process for the current review and specify
    the number of studies included in the previous review. An additional
    box could be added to the flow diagram indicating the number of
    studies included in the previous review (see @fig-prisma-flow-diagram).[@ref132]

-   If applicable, indicate in the PRISMA flow diagram how many records
    were excluded by a human and how many by automation tools.


![PRISMA 2020 flow diagram template for systematic reviews (adapted from flow diagrams proposed by Boers [@ref131] and Mayo-Wilson et al. [@ref65] and Stovold et al. [@ref132]). The boxes in grey should only be completed if applicable; otherwise they should be removed from the flow diagram. Note that a “report” could be a journal article, preprint, conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report, dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report or any other document providing relevant information.](../uploads/prisma_flow_diagram.jpg){#fig-prisma-flow-diagram}


## Explanation

Review authors should report, ideally with a flow
diagram (see @fig-prisma-flow-diagram), the results of the search
and selection process so that readers can understand the flow of
retrieved records through to inclusion in the review. Such information
is useful for future systematic review teams seeking to estimate
resource requirements and for information specialists in evaluating
their searches.[@ref133] [@ref134] Specifying the number of records
yielded per database will make it easier for others to assess whether
they have successfully replicated a search. The flow diagram in @fig-prisma-flow-diagram provides a template of the flow of records through the review separated by source, although other layouts may be
preferable depending on the information sources consulted.[@ref65]

## Example

> "We found 1,333 records in databases searching. After duplicates
removal, we screened 1,092 records, from which we reviewed 34 full-text
documents, and finally included six papers \[each cited\]. Later, we
searched documents that cited any of the initially included studies as
well as the references of the initially included studies. However, no
extra articles that fulfilled inclusion criteria were found in these
searches (a flow diagram is available at
<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233220>)."[@ref189]
