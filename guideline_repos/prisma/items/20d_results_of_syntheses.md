    title: 20d. Sensitivity analyses
---

Present results of all sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the robustness of the synthesised results

## Essential elements

-   If any sensitivity analyses were conducted:

    -   report the results for each sensitivity analysis.

    -   comment on how robust the main analysis was given the results of
        all corresponding sensitivity analyses.

## Additional elements

-   If any sensitivity analyses were conducted, consider:

    -   presenting results in tables that indicate: (i) the summary
        effect estimate, a measure of precision (and potentially other
        relevant statistics, for example, *I^2^* statistic) and
        contributing studies for the original meta-analysis; (ii) the
        same information for the sensitivity analysis; and (iii) details
        of the original and sensitivity analysis assumptions.

    -   presenting results of sensitivity analyses visually using forest
        plots.

## Explanation 

Presenting results of sensitivity analyses conducted
allows readers to assess how robust the synthesised results were to
decisions made during the review process. Reporting results of all
sensitivity analyses is important; presentation of a subset, based on
the nature of the results, risks introducing bias due to selective
reporting. Forest plots are a useful way to present results of
sensitivity analyses; however, these may be best placed in an appendix,
with the main forest plots presented in the main report, to not reduce
readability. An exception may be when sensitivity analyses reveal the
results are not robust to decisions made during the review process.

## Example

> "Sensitivity analyses that removed studies with potential bias showed
consistent results with the primary meta-analyses (risk ratio 1.00 for
undetectable HIV-1 RNA, 1.00 for virological failure, 0.98 for severe
adverse effects, and 1.02 for AIDS defining events; supplement 3E, 3F,
3H, and 3I, respectively). Such sensitivity analyses were not performed
for other outcomes because none of the studies reporting them was at a
high risk of bias. Sensitivity analysis that pooled the outcome data
reported at 48 weeks, which also showed consistent results, was
performed for undetectable HIV-1 RNA and increase in CD4 T cell count
only (supplement 3J and 3K) and not for other outcomes owing to lack of
relevant data. When the standard deviations for increase in CD4 T cell
count were replaced by those estimated by different methods, the results
of @fig-f3 either remained similar (that is,
quadruple and triple arms not statistically different) or favoured
triple therapies (supplement 2)."[@ref192]
