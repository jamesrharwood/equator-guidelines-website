        Did you keep a full record of each search strategy for each database?  If not, make sure you re-visit the searches and create a record of it on the latest day it was searched.  You will need to present all these strategies clearly in the supplementary information 

        For your search strategies, are the date or language or other limits justified in your eligibility criteria? 

        Did you use published approaches to limit your results to certain types of study, or did you devise your own method? 

        Did you use any automated strategies to identify search terms or index headings? 

        Did you validate your strategy by testing whether it could retrieve a set of clearly eligible studies? 

        Did you get your strategy peer reviewed or checked by another method or process? 

        Was your search strategy based on PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) terms?  If not, make sure you describe how you arrived at the concepts you did use.

Present the full search strategies for all databases, registers, and websites, including any filters and limits used

## Essential elements

-   Provide the full line by line search strategy as run in each
    database with a sophisticated interface (such as Ovid), or the
    sequence of terms that were used to search simpler interfaces, such
    as search engines or websites.

-   Describe any limits applied to the search strategy (such as date or
    language) and justify these by linking back to the review's
    eligibility criteria.

-   If published approaches such as search filters designed to retrieve
    specific types of records (for example, filter for randomised
    trials)[@ref44] or search strategies from other systematic reviews,
    were used, cite them. If published approaches were adapted---for
    example, if existing search filters were amended---note the changes
    made.

-   If natural language processing or text frequency analysis tools were
    used to identify or refine keywords, synonyms, or subject indexing
    terms to use in the search strategy,[@ref45] [@ref46] specify the
    tool(s) used.

-   If a tool was used to automatically translate search strings for one
    database to another,[@ref47] specify the tool used.

-   If the search strategy was validated---for example, by evaluating
    whether it could identify a set of clearly eligible studies---report
    the validation process used and specify which studies were included
    in the validation set.[@ref40]

-   If the search strategy was peer reviewed, report the peer review
    process used and specify any tool used, such as the Peer Review of
    Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist.[@ref48]

-   If the search strategy structure adopted was not based on a
    PICO-style approach, describe the final conceptual structure and any
    explorations that were undertaken to achieve it (for example, use of
    a multi-faceted approach that uses a series of searches, with
    different combinations of concepts, to capture a complex research
    question, or use of a variety of different search approaches to
    compensate for when a specific concept is difficult to
    define).[@ref40]

## Explanation

Reporting the full details of all search strategies
(such as the full, line by line search strategy as run in each database)
should enhance the transparency of the systematic review, improve
replicability, and enable a review to be more easily updated.[@ref40]
[@ref42] Presenting only one search strategy from among several hinders
readers' ability to assess how comprehensive the searchers were and does
not provide them with the opportunity to detect any errors. Furthermore,
making only one search strategy available limits replication or updating
of the searches in the other databases, as the search strategies would
need to be reconstructed through adaptation of the one(s) made
available. As well as reporting the search strategies, a description of
the search strategy development process can help readers judge how far
the strategy is likely to have identified all studies relevant to the
review's inclusion criteria. The description of the search strategy
development process might include details of the approaches used to
identify keywords, synonyms, or subject indexing terms used in the
search strategies, or any processes used to validate or peer review the
search strategies. Empirical evidence suggests that peer review of
search strategies is associated with improvements to search strategies,
leading to retrieval of additional relevant records.[@ref43] Further
guidance and examples of reporting search strategies can be found in
PRISMA-Search.[@ref41]

> Search strategy development process: Five known relevant studies were
used to identify records within databases. Candidate search terms were
identified by looking at words in the titles, abstracts and subject
indexing of those records. A draft search strategy was developed using
those terms and additional search terms were identified from the results
of that strategy. Search terms were also identified and checked using
the PubMed PubReMiner word frequency analysis tool. The MEDLINE strategy
makes use of the Cochrane RCT filter reported in the Cochrane Handbook
v5.2. As per the eligibility criteria the strategy was limited to
English language studies. The search strategy was validated by testing
whether it could identify the five known relevant studies and also three
further studies included in two systematic reviews identified as part of
the strategy development process. All eight studies were identified by
the search strategies in MEDLINE and Embase. The strategy was developed
by an information specialist and the final strategies were peer reviewed
by an experienced information specialist within our team. Peer review
involved proofreading the syntax and spelling and overall structure, but
did not make use of the PRESS checklist."[@ref173]
