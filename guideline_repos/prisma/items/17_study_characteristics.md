    text: |
        Present all the included studies in a tabular or graphic format which allows users of the review to compare the key characteristics easily.  

        Is the review of the effects of interventions?  If so, present a summary of characteristics of the interventions of each study so they can also be compared easily.   
---

Cite each included study and present its characteristics.

## Essential elements

-   Cite each included study.
-   Present the key characteristics of each study in a table or figure
    (considering a format that will facilitate comparison of
    characteristics across the studies).

## Additional elements

-   If the review examines the effects of interventions, consider
    presenting an additional table that summarises the intervention
    details for each study.

## Explanation 

Reporting the details of the included studies allows
readers to understand the characteristics of studies that have addressed
the review question(s) and is therefore important for understanding the
applicability of the review. Characteristics of interest might include
study design features, characteristics of participants, how outcomes
were ascertained (such as smoking cessation self reported or
biochemically validated, or specific harms systematically assessed or
reported by participants as they emerged), funding source, and competing
interests of study authors. Presenting the key characteristics of each
study in a table or figure can facilitate comparison of characteristics
across the studies.[@ref92] Citing each study enables retrieval of
relevant reports if desired.

For systematic reviews of interventions, presenting an additional table
that summarises the intervention details for each study (such as using
the template based on the Template for Intervention Description and
Replication (TIDieR)[@ref73]) has several benefits. An intervention
summary table helps readers compare the characteristics of the
interventions and consider those that may be feasible for implementation
in their setting; highlights missing or unavailable details; shows which
studies did not specify certain characteristics as part of the
intervention; and highlights characteristics that have not been
investigated in existing studies.[@ref73] [@ref75]

> In a review examining the association between aspirin use and fracture
risk, the authors included a table presenting for each included study
the citation, study design, country, sample size, setting, mean age,
percentage of females, number of years follow-up, exposure details, and
outcomes assessed (@tbl-studies).[@ref191]
