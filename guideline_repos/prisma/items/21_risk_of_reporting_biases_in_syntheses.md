Present assessments of risk of bias due to missing results (arising from reporting biases) for each synthesis assessed

## Essential elements

-   Present assessments of risk of bias due to missing results (arising
    from reporting biases) for each synthesis assessed.

-   If a tool was used to assess risk of bias due to missing results in
    a synthesis, present responses to questions in the tool, judgments
    about risk of bias, and any information used to support such
    judgments to help readers understand why particular judgments were
    made.

-   If a funnel plot was generated to evaluate small-study effects (one
    cause of which is reporting biases), present the plot and specify
    the effect estimate and measure of precision used in the plot
    (presented typically on the horizontal axis and vertical axis
    respectively[@ref106]). If a contour-enhanced funnel plot was
    generated, specify the "milestones" of statistical significance that
    the plotted contour lines represent (P=0.01, 0.05, 0.1,
    etc).[@ref145]

-   If a test for funnel plot asymmetry was used, report the exact P
    value observed for the test and potentially other relevant
    statistics, such as the standardised normal deviate, from which the
    P value is derived.[@ref106]

-   If any sensitivity analyses seeking to explore the potential impact
    of missing results on the synthesis were conducted, present results
    of each analysis (see item #20d), compare them with results of the
    primary analysis, and report results with due consideration of the
    limitations of the statistical method.[@ref123]

## Additional elements

-   If studies were assessed for selective non-reporting of results by
    comparing outcomes and analyses pre-specified in study registers,
    protocols, and statistical analysis plans with results that were
    available in study reports, consider presenting a matrix (with rows
    as studies and columns as syntheses) to present the availability of
    study results.[@ref124]

-   If an assessment of selective non-reporting of results reveals that
    some studies are missing from the synthesis, consider displaying the
    studies with missing results underneath a forest plot or including a
    table with the available study results (for example, see forest plot
    in Page et al[@ref81]).

## Explanation 

Presenting assessments of the risk of bias due to
missing results in syntheses allows readers to assess potential threats
to the trustworthiness of a systematic review's results. Providing the
evidence used to support judgments of risk of bias allows readers to
determine the validity of the assessments.

## Example

> "Clinical global impression of change was assessed in Doody 2008,
NCT00912288, CONCERT and CONNECTION using the CIBIC-Plus. However, we
were only able to extract results from Doody 2008 \[because no results
for CIBIC-Plus were reported in the other three studies\]...The authors
reported small but significant improvements on the CIBIC‐Plus for 183
patients (89 on latrepirdine and 94 on placebo) favouring latrepirdine
following the 26‐week primary endpoint (MD −0.60, 95% CI −0.89 to −0.31,
P\<0.001). Similar results were found at the additional 52‐week
follow‐up (MD −0.70, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.39, P\<0.001). However, we
considered this to be low quality evidence due to imprecision and
reporting bias. Thus, we could not draw conclusions about the efficacy
of latrepirdine in terms of changes in clinical impression."[@ref196]
