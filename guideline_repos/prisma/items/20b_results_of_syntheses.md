        If you did meta-analyses, for each one report the number of studies, the number of patients, the summary estimate, the standard error or confidence interval, and a measure of statistical heterogeneity (e.g. ùúè2, I2, prediction interval).

        Did you summarize the effect estimates to synthesise the evidence?  If so, report the number of studies, the summary effect size and its measure of precision (the p-value from your test).

        Did you combine the p-values to synthesise the evidence?  If so, report the number of studies and the precision (p-value from your test) and an interpretation of the result without an effect size.  For example, "There was strong evidence of benefit of the intervention in at least one study (P < 0.001, 10 studies)".

        Clearly describe the direction of the effect for each synthesis (e.g. fewer events in the intervention group, or higher pain in the comparator group).

        Did you synthesize mean differences?  If so, specify the unit of measurement for each synthesis, (e.g. kilograms or pounds), the upper and lower limits of the measurement scale (e.g. 0 to 10 on a pain scale), the direction of benefit (e.g. higher scores denote higher severity of pain), and the minimally important difference you have specified in your methods.
        
        Did you synthesize standardised mean differences? If so, give the details of the instrument to which the effect estimates are being re-expressed

Present results of all statistical syntheses conducted. If meta-analysis was done, present for each the summary estimate and its precision (such as confidence/credible interval) and measures of statistical heterogeneity. If comparing groups, describe the direction of the effect.

## Essential elements

-   Report results of all statistical syntheses described in the
    protocol and all syntheses conducted that were not pre-specified.
-   If meta-analysis was conducted, report for each:
    -   the summary estimate and its precision (such as standard error
        or 95% confidence/credible interval).
    -   measures of statistical heterogeneity (such as œÑ^2^, I^2^,
        prediction interval).
-   If other statistical synthesis methods were used (such as
    summarising effect estimates, combining P values), report the
    synthesised result and a measure of precision (or equivalent
    information, for example, the number of studies and total sample
    size).
-   If the statistical synthesis method does not yield an estimate of
    effect (such as when P values are combined), report the relevant
    statistics (such as P value from the statistical test), along with
    an interpretation of the result that is consistent with the question
    addressed by the synthesis method (for example, "There was strong
    evidence of benefit of the intervention in at least one study (P \<
    0.001, 10 studies)" when P values have been combined).[@ref28]
-   If comparing groups, describe the direction of effect (such as fewer
    events in the intervention group, or higher pain in the comparator
    group).
-   If synthesising mean differences, specify for each synthesis, where
    applicable, the unit of measurement (such as kilograms or pounds for
    weight), the upper and lower limits of the measurement scale (for
    example, anchors range from 0 to 10), direction of benefit (for
    example, higher scores denote higher severity of pain), and the
    minimally important difference, if known. If synthesising
    standardised mean differences and the effect estimate is being
    re-expressed to a particular instrument, details of the instrument,
    as per the mean difference, should be reported.

## Explanation 

Users of reviews rely on the reporting of all
statistical syntheses conducted so that they have complete and unbiased
evidence on which to base their decisions. Studies examining selective
reporting of results in systematic reviews have found that 11% to 22% of
reviews did not present results for at least one pre-specified outcome
of the review.[@ref140; @ref141; @ref142; @ref143]

## Example

> "Twelve studies, including a total of 159,086 patients, reported on the
rate of major bleeding complications. Aspirin use was associated with a
46% relative risk increase of major bleeding complications (risk ratio
1.46; 95% CI, 1.30-1.64; p \<‚Äâ0.00001; I^2^ =‚Äâ31%; absolute risk
increase 0.077%; number needed to treat to harm 1295)"[@ref194]
