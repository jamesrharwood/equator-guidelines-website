        Which sources and search methods did you use to look for eligible studies?  

        Sources could include bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE CINAHL EMBASE) and search engines could include Ovid or EBSCOhost.  You could also search study registers, online repositories, or organization or manufacturer websites such as the Health Research Authority or drug company or device manufacturer websites 

        Did you impose date restrictions on your searches? 

        What was the latest date you searched in each information source?

Specify all databases, registers, websites, organisations, reference lists, and other sources searched or consulted to identify studies. Specify the date when each source was last searched or consulted

## Essential elements

-   Specify the date when each source (such as database, register,
    website, organisation) was last searched or consulted.

-   If bibliographic databases were searched, specify for each database
    its name (such as MEDLINE, CINAHL), the interface or platform
    through which the database was searched (such as Ovid, EBSCOhost),
    and the dates of coverage (where this information is provided).

-   If study registers (such as ClinicalTrials.gov), regulatory
    databases (such as Drugs@FDA), and other online repositories (such
    as SIDER Side Effect Resource) were searched, specify the name of
    each source and any date restrictions that were applied.

-   If websites, search engines, or other online sources were browsed or
    searched, specify the name and URL (uniform resource locator) of
    each source.

-   If organisations or manufacturers were contacted to identify
    studies, specify the name of each source.

-   If individuals were contacted to identify studies, specify the types
    of individuals contacted (such as authors of studies included in the
    review or researchers with expertise in the area).

-   If reference lists were examined, specify the types of references
    examined (such as references cited in study reports included in the
    systematic review, or references cited in systematic review reports
    on the same or a similar topic).

-   If cited or citing reference searches (also called backwards and
    forward citation searching) were conducted, specify the
    bibliographic details of the reports to which citation searching was
    applied, the citation index or platform used (such as Web of
    Science), and the date the citation searching was done.

-   If journals or conference proceedings were consulted, specify the
    names of each source, the dates covered and how they were searched
    (such as handsearching or browsing online).


## Explanation

Authors should provide a detailed description of the
information sources, such as bibliographic databases, registers and
reference lists that were searched or consulted, including the dates
when each source was last searched, to allow readers to assess the
completeness and currency of the systematic review, and facilitate
updating.[@ref40] Authors should fully report the "what, when, and how"
of the sources searched; the "what" and "when" are covered in item #6,
and the "how" is covered in item #7. Further guidance and examples about
searching can be found in PRISMA-Search, an extension to the PRISMA
statement for reporting literature searches in systematic
reviews.[@ref41]

## Example

> "On 21 December 2017, MAJ searched 16 health, social care, education,
and legal databases, the names and date coverage of which are given in
the @tbl-sources...We also carried out a
'snowball' search to identify additional studies by searching the
reference lists of publications eligible for full-text review and using
Google Scholar to identify and screen studies citing them...On 26 April
2018, we conducted a search of Google Scholar and additional
supplementary searches for publications on websites of 10 relevant
organisations (including government departments, charities, think-tanks,
and research institutes). Full details of these supplementary searches
can be found in the Additional file. Finally, we updated the database
search on 7 May 2019, and the snowball and additional searches on 10 May
2019 as detailed in the Additional file. We used the same search method,
except that we narrowed the searches to 2017 onwards."[@ref172]
