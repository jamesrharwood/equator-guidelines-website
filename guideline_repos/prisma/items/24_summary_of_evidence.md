Authors should give a brief and balanced summary of the nature and findings of the review. Sometimes, outcomes for which little or no data were found should be noted due to potential relevance for policy decisions and future research. Applicability of the review's findings, to different patients, settings, or target audiences, for example, should be mentioned. Although there is no standard way to assess applicability simultaneously to different audiences, some systems do exist [153]. Sometimes, authors formally rate or assess the overall body of evidence addressed in the review and can present the strength of their summary recommendations tied to their assessments of the quality of evidence (e.g., the GRADE system) [10].

Authors need to keep in mind that statistical significance of the effects does not always suggest clinical or policy relevance. Likewise, a non-significant result does not demonstrate that a treatment is ineffective. Authors should ideally clarify trade-offs and how the values attached to the main outcomes would lead different people to make different decisions. In addition, adroit authors consider factors that are important in translating the evidence to different settings and that may modify the estimates of effects reported in the review [153]. Patients and health care providers may be primarily interested in which intervention is most likely to provide a benefit with acceptable harms, while policy makers and administrators may value data on organizational impact and resource utilization.

## Examples

> Overall, the evidence is not sufficiently robust to determine the comparative effectiveness of angioplasty (with or without stenting) and medical treatment alone. Only 2 randomized trials with long-term outcomes and a third randomized trial that allowed substantial crossover of treatment after 3 months directly compared angioplasty and medical treatmentâ€¦the randomized trials did not evaluate enough patients or did not follow patients for a sufficient duration to allow definitive conclusions to be made about clinical outcomes, such as mortality and cardiovascular or kidney failure events.

> Some acceptable evidence from comparison of medical treatment and angioplasty suggested no difference in long-term kidney function but possibly better blood pressure control after angioplasty, an effect that may be limited to patients with bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. The evidence regarding other outcomes is weak. Because the reviewed studies did not explicitly address patients with rapid clinical deterioration who may need acute intervention, our conclusions do not apply to this important subset of patients.
