        What characteristics of each study were used to assess the risk of bias?   

        Have you explained your judgements, for example by quoting text from the reports of included studies? Present the judgements and explanations for each one clearly in a table or a figure.   

        Did you assess risk of bias for specific outcomes or results? If so, present these judgements in a forest plot alongside the results of each study.

Present assessments of risk of bias for each included study

## Essential elements

-   Present tables or figures indicating for each study the risk of bias
    in each domain/component/item assessed and overall study-level risk
    of bias.
-   Present justification for each risk of bias judgment---for example,
    in the form of relevant quotations from reports of included studies.

## Additional elements

-   If assessments of risk of bias were done for specific outcomes or
    results in each study, consider displaying risk of bias judgments on
    a forest plot, next to the study results, so that the limitations of
    studies contributing to a particular meta-analysis are evident (see
    Sterne et al[@ref86] for an example forest plot).

## Explanation 

For readers to understand the internal validity of a
systematic review's results, they need to know the risk of bias in
results of each included study. Reporting only summary data (such as
"two of eight studies successfully blinded participants") is inadequate
because it fails to inform readers which studies had each particular
methodological shortcoming. A more informative approach is to present
tables or figures indicating for each study the risk of bias in each
domain/component/item assessed (such as blinding of outcome assessors,
missing outcome data), so that users can understand what factors led to
the overall study-level risk of bias judgment.[@ref72] [@ref136]

## Example

> "We used the RoB 2.0 tool to assess risk of bias for each of the
included studies. A summary of these assessments is provided in @tbl-risk-of-bias. In terms of overall risk of bias, there
were concerns about risk of bias for the majority of studies (20/24),
with two of these assessed as at high risk of bias (Musher‚ÄêEizenman
2010; Wansink 2013a). A text summary is provided below for each of the
six individual components of the 'Risk of bias' assessment.
Justifications for assessments are available at the following
