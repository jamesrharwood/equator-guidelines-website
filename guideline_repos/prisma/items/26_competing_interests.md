Declare any competing interests of review authors

## Essential elements

-   Disclose any of the authors' relationships or activities that
    readers could consider pertinent or to have influenced the review.

-   If any authors had competing interests, report how they were managed
    for particular review processes.

## Explanation

Authors of a systematic review may have relationships
with organisations or entities with an interest in the review findings
(for example, an author may serve as a consultant for a company
manufacturing the drug or device under review).[@ref158] Such
relationships or activities are examples of a competing interest (or
conflict of interest), which can negatively affect the integrity and
credibility of systematic reviews. For example, evidence suggests that
systematic reviews with financial competing interests more often have
conclusions favourable to the experimental intervention than systematic
reviews without financial competing interests.[@ref159] Information
about authors' relationships or activities that readers could consider
pertinent or to have influenced the review should be disclosed using the
format requested by the publishing entity (such as using the
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) disclosure
form).[@ref160] Authors should report how competing interests were
managed for particular review processes. For example, if a review author
was an author of an included study, they may have been prevented from
assessing the risk of bias in the study results.

## Example

> "Declarations of interest: R Buchbinder was a principal investigator of
Buchbinder 2009. D Kallmes was a principal investigator of Kallmes 2009
and Evans 2015. D Kallmes participated in IDE trial for Benvenue Medical
spinal augmentation device. He is a stockholder, Marblehead Medical,
LLC, Development of spine augmentation devices. He holds a spinal fusion
patent license, unrelated to spinal augmentation/vertebroplasty. R
Buchbinder and D Kallmes did not perform risk of bias assessments for
their own or any other placebo‐controlled trials included in the
review."[@ref205]
