Describe and explain any amendments to information provided at registration or in the protocol

## Essential elements

-   Report details of any amendments to information provided at
    registration or in the protocol, noting: (*a*) the amendment itself,
    (*b*) the reason for the amendment, and (*c*) the stage of the
    review process at which the amendment was implemented.

## Explanation

Careful consideration of a review's methodological
and analytical approach early on is likely to lessen unnecessary changes
after protocol development.[@ref22] However, it is difficult to
anticipate all scenarios that will arise, necessitating some
clarifications, modifications, and changes to the protocol (such as data
available may not be amenable to the planned meta-analysis).[@ref155]
[@ref156] For reasons of transparency, authors should report details of
any amendments. Amendments could be recorded in various places,
including the full text of the review, a supplementary file, or as
amendments to the published protocol or registration record.

## Example

> "Differences from protocol: We modified the lower limit for age in our
eligibility criteria from 12 years of age to 10 years of age because the
age of adolescence was reduced. We used the WHO measures for severe
anaemia, defined by haemoglobin levels \< 80 g/L instead of \< 70 g/L as
stated in the protocol. We decided to add adverse events to our list of
primary outcomes (instead of secondary) and we changed reinfection rate
to a secondary outcome."[@ref203]
