Cite studies that might appear to meet the inclusion criteria, but which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded.

## Essential elements

-   Cite studies that might appear to meet the inclusion criteria, but
    which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded.

## Explanation

Identifying the excluded records allows readers to
make an assessment of the validity and applicability of the systematic
review.[@ref40] [@ref135] At a minimum, a list of studies that might
appear to meet the inclusion criteria but which were excluded, with
citation and a reason for exclusion, should be reported. This would
include studies meeting most inclusion criteria (such as those with
appropriate intervention and population but an ineligible control or
study design). It is also useful to list studies that were potentially
relevant but for which the full text or data essential to inform
eligibility were not accessible. This information can be reported in the
text or as a list/table in the report or in an online supplement.
Potentially contentious exclusions should be clearly stated in the
report.

## Example

"We excluded seven studies from our review (Bosiers 2015; ConSeQuent;
DEBATE‐ISR; EXCITE ISR; NCT00481780; NCT02832024; RELINE), and we listed
reasons for exclusion in the Characteristics of excluded studies tables.
We excluded studies because they compared stenting in Bosiers 2015 and
RELINE, laser atherectomy in EXCITE ISR, or cutting balloon angioplasty
in NCT00481780 versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for in‐stent
restenosis. The ConSeQuent trial compared DEB versus uncoated balloon
angioplasty for native vessel restenosis rather than in‐stent
restenosis. The DEBATE‐ISR study compared a prospective cohort of
patients receiving DEB therapy for in‐stent restenosis against a
historical cohort of diabetic patients. Finally, the NCT02832024 study
compared stent deployment versus atherectomy versus uncoated balloon
angioplasty alone for in‐stent restenosis."[@ref190]
