**You can use {{< meta acronym >}} if you are writing a systematic review of studies that evaluate the effects of health interventions, irrespective of the design of the included studies.**

You can use this reporting guideline regardless of whether your systematic review included a synthesis (such as pairwise meta-analysis or other statistical synthesis methods) or not (for example, because only one eligible study is identified).

Many of the items are also applicable to:

* writing systematic reviews evaluating other kinds of interventions (such as social or educational interventions)
* systematic reviews with objectives other than evaluating interventions (such as evaluating aetiology, prevalence, or prognosis).

You can also use this reporting guideline to review the _reporting_ of a systematic review, but not for appraising the quality of its design or conduct.
