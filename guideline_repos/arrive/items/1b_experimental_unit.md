## What to write

Describe the experimental unit (e.g., a single animal, litter, or cage of animals).

## Explanation

Within a design, biological and technical factors will
often be organised hierarchically, such as cells within animals and
mitochondria within cells, or cages within rooms and animals within
cages. Such hierarchies can make determining the sample size difficult
(is it the number of animals, cells, or mitochondria?). The sample size
is the number of experimental units per group. The experimental unit is
defined as the biological entity subjected to an intervention
independently of all other units, such that it is possible to assign any
two experimental units to different treatment groups. It is also
sometimes called the unit of randomisation. In addition, the
experimental units should not influence each other on the outcomes that
are measured.

Commonly, the experimental unit is the individual animal, each
independently allocated to a treatment group (e.g., a drug administered
by injection). However, the experimental unit may be the cage or the
litter (e.g., a diet administered to a whole cage, or a treatment
administered to a dam and investigated in her pups), or it could be part
of the animal (e.g., different drug treatments applied topically to
distinct body regions of the same animal). Animals may also serve as
their own controls, receiving different treatments separated by washout
periods; here, the experimental unit is an animal for a period of time.
There may also be multiple experimental units in a single experiment,
such as when a treatment is given to a pregnant dam and then the weaned
pups are allocated to different diets [@pbio.3000411.ref023]. See
[@pbio.3000411.ref017; @pbio.3000411.ref024; @pbio.3000411.ref025]
for further guidance on identifying experimental units.

Conflating experimental units with subsamples or repeated measurements
can lead to artificial inflation of the sample size. For example,
measurements from 50 individual cells from a single mouse represent *n*
= 1 when the experimental unit is the mouse. The 50 measurements are
subsamples and provide an estimate of measurement error and so should be
averaged or used in a nested analysis. Reporting *n* = 50 in this case
is an example of pseudoreplication [@pbio.3000411.ref026]. It
underestimates the true variability in a study, which can lead to false
positives and invalidate the analysis and resulting conclusions
[@pbio.3000411.ref026; @pbio.3000411.ref027]. If, however, each
cell taken from the mouse is then randomly allocated to different
treatments and assessed individually, the cell might be regarded as the
experimental unit.

Clearly indicate the experimental unit for each experiment so that the
sample sizes and statistical analyses can be properly evaluated.

## Examples

> 'The present study used the tissues collected at E15.5 from dams fed the
1X choline and 4X choline diets (*n* = 3 dams per group, per fetal sex;
total *n* = 12 dams). To ensure statistical independence, only one
placenta (either male or female) from each dam was used for each
experiment. Each placenta, therefore, was considered to be an
experimental unit' [@pbio.3000411.ref028].

> 'We have used data collected from high-throughput phenotyping, which is
based on a pipeline concept where a mouse is characterized by a series
of standardized and validated tests underpinned by standard operating
procedures (SOPs).... The individual mouse was considered the
experimental unit within the studies' [@pbio.3000411.ref029].

> 'Fish were divided in two groups according to weight (0.7--1.2 g and
1.3--1.7 g) and randomly stocked (at a density of 15 fish per
experimental unit) in 24 plastic tanks holding 60 L of water'
[@pbio.3000411.ref030].

> 'In the study, *n* refers to number of animals, with five acquisitions
from each corticostriatal slice, with a maximum of three slices
obtained from each experimental animal used for each protocol (six
animals each group)' [@pbio.3000411.ref031].
