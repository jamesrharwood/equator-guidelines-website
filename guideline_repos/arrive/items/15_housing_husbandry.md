## What to write

Provide details of housing and husbandry conditions, including any
environmental enrichment.

## Explanation

The environment determines the health and wellbeing of
the animals, and every aspect of it can potentially affect their
behavioural and physiological responses, thereby affecting research
outcomes [@pbio.3000411.ref175]. Different studies may be sensitive
to different environmental factors, and particular aspects of the
environment necessary to report may depend on the type of study
[@pbio.3000411.ref176]. Examples of housing and husbandry conditions
known to affect animal welfare and research outcomes are listed in @tbl-1; consider reporting
these elements and any other housing and husbandry conditions likely to
influence the study outcomes.

Environment, either deprived or enriched, can affect a wide range of
physiological and behavioural responses [@pbio.3000411.ref206].
Specific details to report include, but are not limited to, structural
enrichment (e.g., elevated surfaces, dividers); resources for
species-typical activities (e.g., nesting material, shelters, or gnawing
sticks for rodents; plants or gravel for aquatic species); and toys or
other tools used to stimulate exploration, exercise (e.g., running
wheel), and novelty. If no environmental enrichment was provided, this
should be clearly stated with justification. Similarly, scientific
justification needs to be reported for withholding food and water
[@pbio.3000411.ref207] and for singly housing animals
[@pbio.3000411.ref208; @pbio.3000411.ref209].

If space is an issue, relevant housing and husbandry details can be
provided in the form of a link to the information in a public repository
or as supplementary information.

  Information to report                                                                    Examples of effects on laboratory animals
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cage/tank/housing system (type and dimensions)                                           Affects behaviour [@pbio.3000411.ref177] and fear learning [@pbio.3000411.ref178]. Tank colour affects stress in aquatic species [@pbio.3000411.ref179; @pbio.3000411.ref180].
  Food and water (type, composition, supplier, and access)                                 Affects body weight, tumour development, nephropathy severity [@pbio.3000411.ref181], and the threshold for developing parkinsonian symptoms [@pbio.3000411.ref182]. Maternal diet affects offspring body weight [@pbio.3000411.ref183].
  Bedding and nesting material                                                             Affects behavioural responses to stress [@pbio.3000411.ref184] and pain [@pbio.3000411.ref185].
  Temperature and humidity                                                                 Modifies tumour progression [@pbio.3000411.ref186]. Regulates sexual differentiation in zebrafish [@pbio.3000411.ref187].
  Sanitation (frequency of cage/tank water changes, material transferred, water quality)   Affects blood pressure, heart rate, behaviour [@pbio.3000411.ref188]. Adds an additional source of variation [@pbio.3000411.ref189; @pbio.3000411.ref190].
  Social environment (group size and composition/stocking density)                         Compromises animal welfare [@pbio.3000411.ref191]. Induces aggressive behaviour [@pbio.3000411.ref192; @pbio.3000411.ref193] and stress [@pbio.3000411.ref180].
  Biosecurity (level)                                                                      The microbiological status of animals causes variation in systemic disease parameters [@pbio.3000411.ref194].
  Lighting (type, schedule, and intensity)                                                 Modifies immune and stress responses [@pbio.3000411.ref195].
  Environmental enrichment                                                                 Reduces anxiety [@pbio.3000411.ref196; @pbio.3000411.ref197], stress [@pbio.3000411.ref196; @pbio.3000411.ref197], and abnormal repetitive behaviour [@pbio.3000411.ref198; @pbio.3000411.ref199; @pbio.3000411.ref200]. Reduces susceptibility to epilepsy [@pbio.3000411.ref201] and osteoarthritis [@pbio.3000411.ref202] and modifies the pathology of neurological disorders [@pbio.3000411.ref203]. Increases foraging behaviour in fish [@pbio.3000411.ref204].
  Sex of the experimenter                                                                  Affects physiological stress and pain behaviour [@pbio.3000411.ref205].

## Examples

> 'Breeding colonies were kept in individually ventilated cages (IVCs;
Tecniplast, Italy) at a temperature of 20°C to 24°C, humidity of 50% to
60%, 60 air exchanges per hour in the cages, and a 12/12-hour light/dark
cycle with the lights on at 5:30 AM. The maximum caging density was five
mice from the same litter and sex starting from weaning. As bedding,
spruce wood shavings (Lignocel FS-14; J. Rettenmaier und Soehne GmbH,
Rosenberg, Germany) were provided. Mice were fed a standardized mouse
diet (1314, Altromin, Germany) and provided drinking water *ad libitum*.
All materials, including IVCs, lids, feeders, bottles, bedding, and
water were autoclaved before use. Sentinel mice were negative for at
least all Federation of laboratory animal science associations
(FELASA)-relevant murine infectious agents... as diagnosed by our health
monitoring laboratory, mfd Diagnostics GmbH, Wendelsheim, Germany'
[@pbio.3000411.ref210].

> 'Same sex litter mates were housed together in individually ventilated
cages with two or four mice per cage. All mice were maintained on a
regular diurnal lighting cycle (12:12 light:-dark) with ad libitum
access to food (7012 Harlan Teklad LM-485 Mouse/Rat Sterilizable Diet)
and water. Chopped corn cob was used as bedding. Environmental
enrichment included nesting material (Nestlets, Ancare, Bellmore, NY,
USA), PVC pipe, and shelter (Refuge XKA-2450-087, Ketchum Manufacturing
Inc., Brockville, Ontario, Canada). Mice were housed under broken
barrier-specific pathogen-free conditions in the Transgenic Mouse Core
Facility of Cornell University, accredited by AAALAC (The Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International)' [@pbio.3000411.ref211].
