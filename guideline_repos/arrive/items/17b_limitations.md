## What to write

Comment on the study limitations, including potential sources
of bias, limitations of the animal model, and imprecision associated
with the results.

## Explanation

Discussing the limitations of the work is important to
place the findings in context, interpret the validity of the results,
and ascribe a credibility level to its conclusions
[@pbio.3000411.ref227]. Limitations are unavoidable in scientific
research, and describing them is essential to share experience, guide
best practice, and aid the design of future experiments
[@pbio.3000411.ref228].

Discuss the quality of evidence presented in the study and consider how
appropriate the animal model is to the specific research question. A
discussion on the rigour of the study design to isolate cause and effect
(also known as internal validity [@pbio.3000411.ref229]) should
include whether potential risks of bias have been addressed
[@pbio.3000411.ref009] (see Item 2. Sample size, Item 3. Inclusion
and exclusion criteria, Item 4. Randomisation, and Item 5. Blinding).

## Examples

> 'Although in this study we did not sample the source herds, the
likelihood of these herds to be IAV positive is high given the
commonality of IAV infections in the Midwest.... However, we cannot
fully rule out the possibility that new gilts became infected with
resident viruses after arrival to the herd. Although new gilts were
placed into isolated designated areas and procedures were in place to
minimize disease transmission (eg. isolation, vaccination), these areas
or procedures might not have been able to fully contain infections
within the designated areas' [@pbio.3000411.ref230].

> 'Even though our data demonstrates that sustained systemic TLR9
stimulation aggravates diastolic HF in our model of gene-targeted
diastolic HF, there are several limitations as to mechanistic
explanations of causality, as well as extrapolations to clinical
inflammatory disease states and other HF conditions. First, our
pharmacological inflammatory model does not allow discrimination between
effects caused by direct cardiac TLR9 stimulation to that of indirect
effects mediated by systemic inflammation. Second, although several
systemic inflammatory conditions have disturbances in the innate immune
system as important features, and some of these again specifically
encompassing distorted TLR9 signalling... sustained TLR9 stimulation
does not necessarily represent a clinically relevant inflammatory
condition. Finally, the cardiac myocyte SERCA2a KO model does not
adequately represent the molecular basis for, or the clinical features
of, diastolic HF' [@pbio.3000411.ref231].
