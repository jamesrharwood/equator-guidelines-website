## What to write

Include sufficient scientific background to understand the
rationale and context for the study, and explain the experimental
approach.

## Explanation

Scientific background information for an animal study
should demonstrate a clear evidence gap and explain why an in vivo
approach was warranted. Systematic reviews of the animal literature
provide the most convincing evidence that a research question has not
been conclusively addressed, by showing the extent of current evidence
within a field of research. They can also inform the choice of animal
model by providing a comprehensive overview of the models used along
with their benefits and limitations
[@pbio.3000411.ref160; @pbio.3000411.ref161; @pbio.3000411.ref162].

Describe the rationale and context of the study and how it relates to
other research, including relevant references to previous work. Outline
evidence underpinning the hypothesis or objectives and explain why the
experimental approach is best suited to answer the research question.

## Example

> 'For decades, cardiovascular disease has remained the leading cause of
mortality worldwide... and cardiovascular research has been
performed using healthy and young, non-diseased animal models. Recent
failures of cardioprotective therapies in obese insulin-resistant ...,
diabetic ..., metabolic syndrome-affected... and aged... animals that
were otherwise successful in healthy animal models has highlighted the
need for the development of animal models of disease that are
representative of human clinical conditions.... The majority of
laboratory-based studies investigating cardiovascular disease and
myocardial tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) are currently
conducted using normogonadic models with either genetically-induced...
or diet-induced... obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). In the
clinical setting, elderly male patients often present with both
testosterone deficiency (TD) and MetS.... A strong and compounding
association exists between metabolic syndrome and testosterone
deficiency which may have significant impact on cardiovascular disease
and its outcomes which is not addressed by current models.... Although
laboratory investigations generally rely on animal models of isolated
metabolic syndrome or hypogonadism, their mutual presentation in the
clinical setting warrants the development of appropriate animal models
of the MetS with hypogonadism, especially in the context of
cardiovascular disease research' [@pbio.3000411.ref163].
