## What to write

For each experimental group, including controls, describe **where** procedures were conducted (including detail of any acclimatisation periods).

## Explanation

Physiological acclimatisation after a stressful event,
such as transport (e.g., between supplier, animal facility, operating
theatre, and laboratory), but before the experiment begins allows
stabilisation of physiological responses of the animal
[@pbio.3000411.ref137; @pbio.3000411.ref138]. Protocols vary
depending on species, strain, and outcome; for example, physiological
acclimatisation following transportation of different animals can take
anywhere from 24 hours to more than 1 week [@pbio.3000411.ref139].
Procedural acclimatisation immediately before a procedure allows
stabilisation of the animals' responses after unaccustomed handling,
novel environments, and previous procedures, which otherwise can induce
behavioural and physiological changes
[@pbio.3000411.ref140; @pbio.3000411.ref141]. Standard
acclimatisation periods may vary between research laboratories, and this
information cannot be inferred by readers.

Indicate where studies were performed (e.g., dedicated laboratory space
or animal facility, home cage, open field arena, water maze) and whether
periods of physiological or procedural acclimatisation were included in
the study protocol, including type and duration. If the study involved
multiple sites, explicitly state where each experiment and sample
analysis was performed. Include any accreditation of laboratories if
appropriate (e.g., if samples were sent to a commercial laboratory for
analysis).

## Example

> 'Fish were singly housed for 1 week before being habituated to the
conditioning tank over 2 consecutive days. The conditioning tank
consisted of an opaque tank measuring 20 cm (w) 15 cm (h) 30 cm (l)
containing 2.5L of aquarium water with distinct visual cues (spots or
stripes) on walls at each end of the tank.... During habituation, each
individual fish was placed in the conditioning apparatus for 20 minutes
with free access to both compartments and then returned to its home
tank' [@pbio.3000411.ref142].
