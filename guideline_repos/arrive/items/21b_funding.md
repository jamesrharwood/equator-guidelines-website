## What to write

List all funding sources (including grant identifier) and the role of the funder(s) in the design, analysis, and reporting of the study.

## Explanation

The identification of funding sources allows the reader
to assess any competing interests and any potential sources of bias. For
example, bias, as indicated by a prevalence of more favourable outcomes,
has been demonstrated for clinical research funded by industry compared
with studies funded by other sources
[@pbio.3000411.ref257; @pbio.3000411.ref258; @pbio.3000411.ref259]. Evidence for
preclinical research also indicates that funding sources may influence
the interpretation of study outcomes
[@pbio.3000411.ref254; @pbio.3000411.ref260].

Report the funding information including the financial supporting
body(s) and any grant identifier(s). If the study was supported by
several sources of funding, list them all, including internal grants.
Specify the role of the funder in the design, analysis, reporting,
and/or decision to publish. If the research did not receive specific
funding but was performed as part of the employment of the authors, name
the employer.
