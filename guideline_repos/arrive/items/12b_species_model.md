## What to write

Explain how the animal species and model used address the
scientific objectives and, where appropriate, the relevance to human
biology.

## Explanation

Provide enough detail for the reader to assess the
suitability of the animal model used to address the research question.
Include information on the rationale for choosing a particular species
and explain how the outcome measures assessed are relevant to the
condition under study and how the model was validated. Stating that an
animal model is commonly used in the field is not appropriate, and a
well-considered, detailed rationale should be provided.

When the study models an aspect of a human disease, indicate how the
model is appropriate for addressing the specific objectives of the study
[@pbio.3000411.ref164]. This can include a description of how the
induction of the disease, disorder, or injury is sufficiently analogous
to the human condition; how the model responds to known clinically
effective treatments; how similar symptoms are to the clinical disease;
and how animal characteristics were selected to represent the age, sex,
and health status of the clinical population [@pbio.3000411.ref014].

## Examples

> 'For this purpose, we selected a pilocarpine model of epilepsy that is
characterized by robust, frequent spontaneous seizures acquired after a
brain insult ..., well-described behavioral abnormalities ..., and poor
responses to antiepileptic drugs.... These animals recapitulate several
key features of human temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common type of
epilepsy in adults' [@pbio.3000411.ref165].

> 'Transplantation of healthy haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a
critical therapy for a wide range of malignant haematological and
non-malignant disorders and immune dysfunction.... Zebrafish are already
established as a successful model to study the haematopoietic system,
with significant homology with mammals.... Imaging of zebrafish
transparent embryos remains a powerful tool and has been critical to
confirm that the zebrafish Caudal Haematopoietic Tissue (CHT) is
comparable to the mammalian foetal haematopoietic niche....
Xenotransplantation in zebrafish embryos has revealed highly conserved
mechanisms between zebrafish and mammals. Recently, murine bone marrow
cells were successfully transplanted into zebrafish embryos, revealing
highly conserved mechanism of haematopoiesis between zebrafish and
mammals.... Additionally, CD34 enriched human cells transplanted into
zebrafish were shown to home to the CHT and respond to zebrafish
stromal-cell derived factors' [@pbio.3000411.ref166].
