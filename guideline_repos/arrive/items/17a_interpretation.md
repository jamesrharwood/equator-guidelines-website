## What to write

Interpret the results, taking into account the study objectives and hypotheses, current theory, and other relevant studies in the literature.

## Explanation

It is important to interpret the results of the study
in the context of the study objectives (see Item 13. Objectives). For
hypothesis-testing studies, interpretations should be restricted to the
primary outcome (see Item 6. Outcome measures). Exploratory results
derived from additional outcomes should not be described as conclusive,
as they may be underpowered and less reliable.

Discuss the findings in the context of current theory, ideally with
reference to a relevant systematic review, as individual studies do not
provide a complete picture. If a systematic review is not available,
take care to avoid selectively citing studies that corroborate the
results or only those that report statistically significant findings
[@pbio.3000411.ref223].

When appropriate, describe any implications of the experimental methods
or research findings for improving welfare standards or reducing the
number of animals used in future studies (e.g., the use of a novel
approach reduced the results' variability, thus enabling the use of
smaller group sizes without losing statistical power). This may not be
the primary focus of the research, but reporting this information
enables wider dissemination and uptake of refined techniques within the
scientific community.

## Examples

> 'This is in contrast to data provided by an 'intra-renal IL-18
overexpression' model ..., and may reflect an IL-18 concentration
exceeding the physiologic range in the latter study'
[@pbio.3000411.ref224].

> 'The new apparatus shows potential for considerably reducing the number
of animals used in memory tasks designed to detect potential amnesic
properties of new drugs... approximately 43,000 animals have been used
in these tasks in the past 5 years but with the application of the
continual trials apparatus we estimate that this could have been reduced
to 26,000 ... with the new paradigm the number of animals needed to
obtain reliable results and maintain the statistical power of the tasks
is greatly reduced' [@pbio.3000411.ref225].

> 'In summary, our results show that IL-1Ra protects against brain injury
and reduces neuroinflammation when administered peripherally to aged and
comorbid animals at reperfusion or 3â€‰hours later. These findings address
concerns raised in a recent systematic review on IL-1Ra in stroke... and
provide further supporting evidence for IL-1Ra as a lead candidate for
the treatment of ischemic stroke' [@pbio.3000411.ref226].
