## What to write

Describe who was aware of the group allocation at the different stages
of the experiment (during the allocation, the conduct of the experiment,
the outcome assessment, and the data analysis).

## Explanation

Researchers often expect a particular outcome and can
unintentionally influence the experiment or interpret the data in such a
way as to support their preferred hypothesis [@pbio.3000411.ref081].
Blinding is a strategy used to minimise these subjective biases.

Although there is primary evidence of the impact of blinding in the
clinical literature that directly compares blinded versus unblinded
assessment of outcomes [@pbio.3000411.ref082], there is limited
empirical evidence in animal research
[@pbio.3000411.ref083; @pbio.3000411.ref084]. There are, however,
compelling data from systematic reviews showing that nonblinded outcome
assessment leads to the treatment effects being overestimated, and the
lack of bias-reducing measures such as randomisation and blinding can
contribute to as much as 30%--45% inflation of effect sizes
[@pbio.3000411.ref067; @pbio.3000411.ref068; @pbio.3000411.ref085].

Ideally, investigators should be unaware of the treatment(s) animals
have received or will be receiving, from the start of the experiment
until the data have been analysed. If this is not possible for every
stage of an experiment (see @sec-blinding-stages), it should always be
possible to conduct at least some of the stages blind. This has
implications for the organisation of the experiment and may require help
from additional personnel---for example, a surgeon to perform
interventions, a technician to code the treatment syringes for each
animal, or a colleague to code the treatment groups for the analysis.
Online resources are available to facilitate allocation concealment and
blinding [@pbio.3000411.ref019].

Specify whether blinding was used or not for each step of the
experimental process (see @sec-blinding-stages) and indicate what
particular treatment or condition the investigators were blinded to, or
aware of.

If blinding was not used at any of the steps outlined in @sec-blinding-stages, explicitly state this
and provide the reason why blinding was not possible or not considered.

## Blinding during different stages of an experiment {#sec-blinding-stages}

### During allocation

Allocation concealment refers to concealing the treatment to be
allocated to each individual animal from those assigning the animals to
groups, until the time of assignment. Together with randomisation,
allocation concealment helps minimise selection bias, which can
introduce systematic differences between treatment groups.

### During the conduct of the experiment

When possible, animal care staff and those who administer treatments
should be unaware of allocation groups to ensure that all animals in the
experiment are handled, monitored, and treated in the same way. Treating
different groups differently based on the treatment they have received
could alter animal behaviour and physiology and produce confounds.

Welfare or safety reasons may prevent blinding of animal care staff, but
in most cases, blinding is possible. For example, if hazardous
microorganisms are used, control animals can be considered as dangerous
as infected animals. If a welfare issue would only be tolerated for a
short time in treated but not control animals, a harm-benefit analysis
is needed to decide whether blinding should be used.

### During the outcome assessment

The person collecting experimental measurements or conducting
assessments should not know which treatment each sample/animal received
and which samples/animals are grouped together. Blinding is especially
important during outcome assessment, particularly if there is a
subjective element (e.g., when assessing behavioural changes or reading
histological slides) [@pbio.3000411.ref083]. Randomising the order
of examination can also reduce bias.

If the person assessing the outcome cannot be blinded to the group
allocation (e.g., obvious phenotypic or behavioural differences between
groups), some, but not all, of the sources of bias could be mitigated by
sending data for analysis to a third party who has no vested interest in
the experiment and does not know whether a treatment is expected to
improve or worsen the outcome.

### During the data analysis

The person analysing the data should know which data are grouped
together to enable group comparisons but should not be aware of which
specific treatment each group received. This type of blinding is often
neglected but is important, as the analyst makes many semisubjective
decisions such as applying data transformation to outcome measures,
choosing methods for handling missing data, and handling outliers. How
these decisions will be made should also be decided a priori.

Data can be coded prior to analysis so that the treatment group cannot
be identified before analysis is completed.

## Examples

> 'For each animal, four different investigators were involved as follows:
a first investigator (RB) administered the treatment based on the
randomization table. This investigator was the only person aware of the
treatment group allocation. A second investigator (SC) was responsible
for the anaesthetic procedure, whereas a third investigator (MS, PG, IT)
performed the surgical procedure. Finally, a fourth investigator (MAD)
(also unaware of treatment) assessed GCPS and NRS, mechanical
nociceptive threshold (MNT), and sedation NRS scores'
[@pbio.3000411.ref046].

> '... due to overt behavioral seizure activity the experimenter could not
be blinded to whether the animal was injected with pilocarpine or with
saline' [@pbio.3000411.ref086].

> 'Investigators could not be blinded to the mouse strain due to the
difference in coat colors, but the three-chamber sociability test was
performed with ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting, Wood Dale,
IL, USA) using an overhead video camera system to automate behavioral
testing and provide unbiased data analyses. The one-chamber social
interaction test requires manual scoring and was analyzed by an
individual with no knowledge of the questions'
[@pbio.3000411.ref087].
