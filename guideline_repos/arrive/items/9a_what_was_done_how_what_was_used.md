    text: What was done, how it was done, and what was used.

## What to write

For each experimental group, including controls, describe **what was done, how it was done, and what was used**.

## Explanation

Essential information to describe in the manuscript
includes the procedures used to develop the model (e.g., induction of
the pathology), the procedures used to measure the outcomes, and pre-
and postexperimental procedures, including animal handling, welfare
monitoring, and euthanasia. Animal handling can be a source of stress,
and the specific method used (e.g., mice picked up by tail or in cupped
hands) can affect research outcomes
[@pbio.3000411.ref061; @pbio.3000411.ref121; @pbio.3000411.ref122].
Details about animal care and monitoring intrinsic to the procedure are
discussed in further detail in Item 16. Animal care and monitoring.
Provide enough detail to enable others to replicate the methods and
highlight any quality assurance and quality control used
[@pbio.3000411.ref123; @pbio.3000411.ref124]. A schematic of the
experimental procedures with a timeline can give a clear overview of how
the study was conducted. Information relevant to distinct types of
interventions and resources are described in @tbl-info.

When available, cite the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) for
reagents and tools used
[@pbio.3000411.ref126; @pbio.3000411.ref127]. RRIDs are unique and
stable, allowing unambiguous identification of reagents or tools used in
a study, aiding other researchers to replicate the methods.

Detailed step-by-step procedures can also be saved and shared online,
for example, using Protocols.io [@pbio.3000411.ref128], which
assigns a digital object identifier (DOI) to the protocol and allows
cross-referencing between protocols and publications.
