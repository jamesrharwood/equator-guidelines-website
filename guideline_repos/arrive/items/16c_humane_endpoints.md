## What to write

Describe the humane endpoints established for the study, the
signs that were monitored, and the frequency of monitoring. If the
study did not set humane endpoints, state this.

## Explanation

Humane endpoints are predetermined morphological,
physiological, and/or behavioural signs that define the circumstances
under which an animal will be removed from an experimental study. The
use of humane endpoints can help minimise harm while allowing the
scientific objectives to be achieved [@pbio.3000411.ref219]. Report
the humane endpoints that were established for the specific study,
species, and strain. Include clear criteria of the clinical signs
monitored [@pbio.3000411.ref134] and clinical signs that led to
euthanasia or other defined actions. Include details such as general
welfare indicators (e.g., weight loss, reduced food intake, abnormal
posture) and procedure-specific welfare indicators (e.g., tumour size in
cancer studies [@pbio.3000411.ref050], sensory-motor deficits in
stroke studies [@pbio.3000411.ref220]).

Report the timing and frequency of monitoring, taking into consideration
the normal circadian rhythm of the animal and timing of scientific
procedures, as well as any increase in the frequency of monitoring
(e.g., postsurgery recovery, critical times during disease studies, or
following the observation of an adverse event). Publishing score sheets
of the clinical signs that were monitored [@pbio.3000411.ref221] can
help guide other researchers to develop clinically relevant welfare
assessments, particularly for studies reporting novel procedures.

This information should be reported even if no animal reached any of the
humane endpoints. If no humane endpoints were established for the study,
explicitly state this.

## Examples

> 'Both the research team and the veterinary staff monitored animals twice
daily. Health was monitored by weight (twice weekly), food and water
intake, and general assessment of animal activity, panting, and fur
condition.... The maximum size the tumors allowed to grow in the mice
before euthanasia was 2000 mm^3^' [@pbio.3000411.ref222].
