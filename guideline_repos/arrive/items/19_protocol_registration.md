## What to write

Provide a statement indicating whether a protocol (including the research question, key design features, and analysis plan) was prepared before the study, and if and where this protocol was registered.

## Explanation

Akin to the approach taken for clinical trials,
protocol registration has emerged as a mechanism that is likely to
improve the transparency of animal research
[@pbio.3000411.ref232; @pbio.3000411.ref237; @pbio.3000411.ref238].
Registering a protocol before the start of the experiment enables
researchers to demonstrate that the hypothesis, approach, and analysis
were planned in advance and not shaped by data as they emerged; it
enhances scientific rigour and protects the researcher against concerns
about selective reporting of results
[@pbio.3000411.ref239; @pbio.3000411.ref240]. A protocol should
consist of (1) the question being addressed and the key features of the
research that is proposed, such as the hypothesis being tested, the
primary outcome measure (if applicable), and the statistical analysis
plan; and (2) the laboratory procedures to be used to perform the
planned experiment.

Protocols may be registered with different levels of completeness. For
example, in the Registered Report format offered by an increasing number
of journals, protocols undergo peer review, and if accepted, the journal
commits to publishing the completed research regardless of the results
obtained [@pbio.3000411.ref237].

Other online resources include the Open Science Framework
[@pbio.3000411.ref241], which is suitable to deposit PHISPS
(Population; Hypothesis; Intervention; Statistical Analysis Plan;
Primary; Outcome Measure; Sample Size Calculation) protocols
[@pbio.3000411.ref242] and provide researchers with the flexibility
to embargo the preregistration, keep it from public view until the
research is published, and selectively share it with reviewers and
editors. The EDA can also be used to generate a time-stamped PDF, which
sets out key elements of the experimental design
[@pbio.3000411.ref019]. This can be used to demonstrate that the
study conduct, analysis, and reporting were not unduly driven by
emerging data. As a minimum, we recommend registering protocols
containing all PHISPS components as outlined above.

Provide a statement indicating whether or not any protocol was prepared
before the study, and if applicable, provide the time-stamped protocol
or the location of its registration. When there have been deviations
from the protocol, describe the rationale for these changes in the
publication so that readers can take this into account when assessing
the findings.

## Examples

> 'A detailed description of all protocols can be found in the Registered
Report (Kandela et al., 2015). Additional detailed experimental notes,
data, and analysis are available on the Open Science Framework (OSF)
(RRID: SCR_003238) (<https://osf.io/xu1g2/>)'
[@pbio.3000411.ref243].

> 'To maximize the objectivity of the presented research, we preregistered
this study with its 2 hypotheses, its planned methods, and its complete
plan of data analysis before the start of data collection
(<https://osf.io/eb8ua/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67>, accessed 29
December 2017). We closely adhered to our plan.... All statistical
analyses closely followed our preregistered analysis plan
(<https://osf.io/eb8ua/>)' [@pbio.3000411.ref244].

> 'We preregistered our analyses with the Open Science Framework which
facilitates reproducibility and open collaboration in science
research.... Our preregistration: Sheldon and Griffith (2017), was
carried out to limit the number of analyses conducted and to validate
our commitment to testing a limited number of a priori hypotheses. Our
methods are consistent with this preregistration ...'
