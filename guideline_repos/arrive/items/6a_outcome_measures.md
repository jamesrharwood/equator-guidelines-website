## What to write

Clearly define all outcome measures assessed (e.g., cell
death, molecular markers, or behavioural changes).

## Explanation

An outcome measure (also known as a dependent variable
or a response variable) is any variable recorded during a study (e.g.,
volume of damaged tissue, number of dead cells, specific molecular
marker) to assess the effects of a treatment or experimental
intervention. Outcome measures may be important for characterising a
sample (e.g., baseline data) or for describing complex responses (e.g.,
'haemodynamic' outcome measures including heart rate, blood pressure,
central venous pressure, and cardiac output). Failure to disclose all
the outcomes that were measured introduces bias in the literature, as
positive outcomes (e.g., those statistically significant) are reported
more often [@pbio.3000411.ref088; @pbio.3000411.ref089; @pbio.3000411.ref090; @pbio.3000411.ref091].

Explicitly describe what was measured, especially when measures can be
operationalised in different ways. For example, activity could be
recorded as time spent moving or distance travelled. When possible, the
recording of outcome measures should be made in an unbiased manner
(e.g., blinded to the treatment allocation of each experimental group;
see Item 5. Blinding). Specify how the outcome measure(s) assessed are
relevant to the objectives of the study.

## Example

> 'The following parameters were assessed: threshold pressure (TP;
intravesical pressure immediately before micturition); post-void
pressure (PVP; intravesical pressure immediately after micturition);
peak pressure (PP; highest intravesical pressure during micturition);
capacity (CP; volume of saline needed to induce the first micturition);
compliance (CO; CP to TP ratio); frequency of voiding contractions (VC)
and frequency of non-voiding contractions (NVCs)'
[@pbio.3000411.ref092].
