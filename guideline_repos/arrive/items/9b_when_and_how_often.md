## What to write

For each experimental group, including controls, describe **when and how often** procedures were performed.

## Explanation

Clearly report the frequency and timing of experimental
procedures and measurements, including the light and dark cycle (e.g.,
12L:12D), circadian time cues (e.g., lights on at 8:00 AM), and
experimental time sequence (e.g., interval between baseline and
comparator measurements or interval between procedures and
measurements). Along with innate circadian rhythms, these can affect
research outcomes such as behavioural, physiological, and immunological
parameters [@pbio.3000411.ref132; @pbio.3000411.ref133]. Also
report the timing and frequency of welfare assessments, taking into
consideration the normal activity patterns (see Item 16. Animal care and
monitoring). For example, nocturnal animals may not show behavioural
signs of discomfort during the day [@pbio.3000411.ref134].

If the timing of procedures or measurements varies between animals, this
information can be provided as a supplementary table listing each
animal.

## Examples

> 'Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and amount of blood
extracted were recorded every 5 minutes. Blood samples were drawn at
baseline (pre injury), 0 minutes (immediately after injury), and after
30 and 60 minutes' [@pbio.3000411.ref135].

> 'After a 5-h fast (7:30--12:30am), awake and freely moving mice were
randomized and subjected to three consecutive clamps performed in the
same mice as described above, with a 2 days recovery after each
hyperinsulinemic/hypoglycemic (mHypo, *n* = 6) or
hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic (mEugly, *n* = 4) clamps'
[@pbio.3000411.ref136].
