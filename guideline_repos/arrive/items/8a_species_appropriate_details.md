## What to write

Provide species-appropriate details of the animals used, including species, strain and substrain, sex, age or developmental stage, and, if relevant, weight.

## Explanation

The species, strain, substrain, sex, weight, and age of
animals are critical factors that can influence most experimental
results [@pbio.3000411.ref103; @pbio.3000411.ref104; @pbio.3000411.ref105; @pbio.3000411.ref106; @pbio.3000411.ref107]. Reporting
the characteristics of all animals used is equivalent to standardised
human patient demographic data; these data support both the internal and
external validity of the study results. It enables other researchers to
repeat the experiment and generalise the findings. It also enables
readers to assess whether the animal characteristics chosen for the
experiment are relevant to the research objectives.

When reporting age and weight, include summary statistics for each
experimental group (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and, if possible,
baseline values for individual animals (e.g., as supplementary
information or a link to a publicly accessible data repository). As body
weight might vary during the course of the study, indicate when the
measurements were taken. For most species, precise reporting of age is
more informative than a description of the developmental status (e.g., a
mouse referred to as an adult can vary in age from 6 to 20 weeks
[@pbio.3000411.ref108]). In some cases, however, reporting the
developmental stage is more informative than chronological age---for
example, in juvenile *Xenopus*, in which rate of development can be
manipulated by incubation temperature [@pbio.3000411.ref109].

Reporting the weight or the sex of the animals used may not feasible for
all studies. For example, sex may be unknown for embryos or juveniles,
or weight measurement may be particularly stressful for some aquatic
species. If reporting these characteristics can be reasonably expected
for the species used and the experimental setting but are not reported,
provide a justification.

## Examples

> 'One hundred and nineteen male mice were used: C57BL/6OlaHsd mice (*n* =
59), and BALB/c OlaHsd mice (*n* = 60) (both from Harlan, Horst, The
Netherlands). At the time of the EPM test the mice were 13 weeks old and
had body weights of 27.4 ± 0.4 g and 27.8 ± 0.3 g, respectively (mean ±
SEM)' [@pbio.3000411.ref110].

> 'Histone Methylation Profiles and the Transcriptome of *X*. *tropicalis*
Gastrula Embryos. To generate epigenetic profiles, ChIP was performed
using specific antibodies against trimethylated H3K4 and H3K27 in
*Xenopus* gastrula-stage embryos (Nieuwkoop-Faber stage 11--12),
followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). In addition, polyA-selected RNA
(stages 10--13) was reverse transcribed and sequenced (RNA-seq)'
[@pbio.3000411.ref111].
