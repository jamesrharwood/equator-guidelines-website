## What to write

Describe any criteria used for including or excluding animals
(or experimental units) during the experiment, and data points during
the analysis.

Specify if these criteria were established a priori.

If no criteria were set, state this explicitly.

## Explanation

Inclusion and exclusion criteria define the eligibility
or disqualification of animals and data once the study has commenced. To
ensure scientific rigour, the criteria should be defined before the
experiment starts and data are collected
[@pbio.3000411.ref008; @pbio.3000411.ref033; @pbio.3000411.ref048; @pbio.3000411.ref049].
Inclusion criteria should not be confused with animal characteristics
(see Item 8. Experimental animals) but can be related to these (e.g.,
body weights must be within a certain range for a particular procedure)
or related to other study parameters (e.g., task performance has to
exceed a given threshold). In studies in which selected data are
reanalysed for a different purpose, inclusion and exclusion criteria
should describe how data were selected.

Exclusion criteria may result from technical or welfare issues such as
complications anticipated during surgery or circumstances in which test
procedures might be compromised (e.g., development of motor impairments
that could affect behavioural measurements). Criteria for excluding
samples or data include failure to meet quality control standards, such
as insufficient sample volumes, unacceptable levels of contaminants,
poor histological quality, etc. Similarly, how the researcher will
define and handle data outliers during the analysis should also be
decided before the experiment starts (see subitem 3b for guidance on
responsible data cleaning).

Exclusion criteria may also reflect the ethical principles of a study in
line with its humane endpoints (see Item 16. Animal care and
monitoring). For example, in cancer studies, an animal might be dropped
from the study and euthanised before the predetermined time point if the
size of a subcutaneous tumour exceeds a specific volume
[@pbio.3000411.ref050]. If losses are anticipated, these should be
considered when determining the number of animals to include in the
study (see Item 2. Sample size). Whereas exclusion criteria and humane
endpoints are typically included in the ethical review application,
reporting the criteria used to exclude animals or data points in the
manuscript helps readers with the interpretation of the data and
provides crucial information to other researchers wanting to adopt the
model.

Best practice is to include all a priori inclusion and exclusion/outlier
criteria in a preregistered protocol (see Item 19. Protocol
registration). At the very least, these criteria should be documented in
a laboratory notebook and reported in manuscripts, explicitly stating
that the criteria were defined before any data was collected.

## Example

'The animals were included in the study if they underwent successful MCA
occlusion (MCAo), defined by a 60% or greater drop in cerebral blood
flow seen with laser Doppler flowmetry. The animals were excluded if
insertion of the thread resulted in perforation of the vessel wall
(determined by the presence of sub-arachnoid blood at the time of
sacrifice), if the silicon tip of the thread became dislodged during
withdrawal, or if the animal died prematurely, preventing the collection
of behavioral and histological data' [@pbio.3000411.ref051].
