## What to write

For hypothesis-testing studies, specify the primary outcome
measure, i.e., the outcome measure that was used to determine the sample
size.

## Explanation

In a hypothesis-testing experiment, the primary outcome
measure answers the main biological question. It is the outcome of
greatest importance, identified in the planning stages of the experiment
and used as the basis for the sample size calculation (see Item 2b. Sample Size). For exploratory
studies, it is not necessary to identify a single primary outcome, and
often multiple outcomes are assessed (see Item 13. Objectives).

In a hypothesis-testing study powered to detect an effect on the primary
outcome measure, data on secondary outcomes are used to evaluate
additional effects of the intervention, but subsequent statistical
analysis of secondary outcome measures may be underpowered, making
results and interpretation less reliable
[@pbio.3000411.ref088; @pbio.3000411.ref093]. Studies that claim to
test a hypothesis but do not specify a predefined primary outcome
measure or those that change the primary outcome measure after data were
collected (also known as primary outcome switching) are liable to
selectively report only statistically significant results, favouring
more positive findings [@pbio.3000411.ref094].

Registering a protocol in advance protects the researcher against
concerns about selective outcome reporting (also known as data dredging
or p-hacking) and provides evidence that the primary outcome reported in
the manuscript accurately reflects what was planned
[@pbio.3000411.ref095] (see Item 19. Protocol registration).

In studies using inferential statistics to test a hypothesis (e.g., *t*
test, ANOVA), if more than one outcome was assessed, explicitly identify
the primary outcome measure, state whether it was defined as such prior
to data collection and whether it was used in the sample size
calculation. If there was no primary outcome measure, explicitly state
so.

## Examples

> 'The primary outcome of this study will be forelimb function assessed
with the staircase test. Secondary outcomes constitute Rotarod
performance, stroke volume (quantified on MR imaging or brain sections,
respectively), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) connectome mapping, and
histological analyses to measure neuronal and microglial densities, and
phagocytic activity.... The study is designed with 80% power to detect a
relative 25% difference in pellet-reaching performance in the Staircase
test' [@pbio.3000411.ref096].

> 'The primary endpoint of this study was defined as left ventricular
ejection fraction (EF) at the end of follow-up, measured by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary endpoints were left ventricular end
diastolic volume and left ventricular end systolic volume (EDV and ESV)
measured by MRI, infarct size measured by ex vivo gross macroscopy after
incubation with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI, functional parameters serially measured by
pressure volume (PV-)loop and echocardiography, coronary microvascular
function by intracoronary pressure- and flow measurements and vascular
density and fibrosis on histology' [@pbio.3000411.ref076].
