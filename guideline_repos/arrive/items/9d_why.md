## What to write

For each experimental group, including controls, describe **why** procedures were conducted.

## Explanation

There may be numerous approaches to investigate any
given research problem; therefore, it is important to explain why a
particular procedure or technique was chosen. This is especially
relevant when procedures are novel or specific to a research laboratory
or constrained by the animal model or experimental equipment (e.g.,
route of administration determined by animal size
[@pbio.3000411.ref143]).

## Examples

> 'Because of the very small caliber of the murine tail veins, partial
paravenous injection is common if ^18^F-FDG is administered by tail vein
injection (intravenous). This could have significantly biased our
comparison of the biodistribution of ^18^F-FDG under various conditions.
Therefore, we used intraperitoneal injection of ^18^F-FDG for our
experiments evaluating the influence of animal handling on ^18^F-FDG
biodistribution' [@pbio.3000411.ref144].

> 'Since *Xenopus* oocytes have a higher potential for homologous
recombination than fertilized embryos... we next tested whether the host
transfer method could be used for efficient HDR-mediated knock-in. We
targeted the C-terminus of *X*. *laevis* Ctnnb1 (Î²-catenin), a key
cytoskeletal protein and effector of the canonical Wnt pathway, because
previous studies have shown that addition of epitope tags to the
C-terminus do not affect the function of the resulting fusion protein
(Fig ...). CRISPR components were injected into *X*. *laevis* oocytes
followed by host transfer or into embryos' [@pbio.3000411.ref145].
