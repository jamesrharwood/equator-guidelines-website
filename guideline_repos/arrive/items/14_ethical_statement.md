## What to write

Provide the name of the ethical review committee or equivalent that
has approved the use of animals in this study and any relevant licence
or protocol numbers (if applicable). If ethical approval was not
sought or granted, provide a justification.

## Explanation

Authors are responsible for complying with regulations
and guidelines relating to the use of animals for scientific purposes.
This includes ensuring that they have the relevant approval for their
study from an appropriate ethics committee and/or regulatory body before
the work starts. The ethical statement provides editors, reviewers, and
readers with assurance that studies have received this ethical oversight
[@pbio.3000411.ref012]. This also promotes transparency and
understanding about the use of animals in research and fosters public
trust.

Provide a clear statement explaining how the study conforms to
appropriate regulations and guidelines. Include the name of the
institution where the research was approved and the ethics committee who
reviewed it (e.g., Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC
in the United States or Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body AWERB
in the United Kingdom) and indicate protocol or project licence numbers
so that the study can be identified. Also add any relevant
accreditation, e.g., American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) [@pbio.3000411.ref171] or Good
Laboratory Practice (GLP).

If the research is not covered by any regulation and formal ethical
approval is not required (e.g., a study using animal species not
protected by regulations or law), demonstrate that international
standards were complied with and cite the appropriate reference. In such
cases, provide a clear statement explaining why the research is exempt
from regulatory approval.

## Examples

> 'All procedures were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom
Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, approved by institutional
ethical review committees (Alderley Park Animal Welfare and Ethical
Review Board and Babraham Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review
Board) and conducted under the authority of the Project Licence (40/3729
and 70/8307, respectively)' [@pbio.3000411.ref172].

> 'All protocols in this study were approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments of Fuwai Hospital, Peking Union Medical
College and the Beijing Council on Animal Care, Beijing, China (IACUC
permit number: FW2010-101523), in compliance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of
Health (NIH publication no.85-23, revised 1996)'
[@pbio.3000411.ref173].

> 'Samples and data were collected according to Institut de SÃ©lection
d'Animale (ISA) protocols, under the supervision of ISA employees.
Samples and data were collected as part of routine animal data
collection in a commercial breeding program for layer chickens in The
Netherlands. Samples and data were collected on a breeding nucleus of
ISA for breeding purposes only, and is a non-experimental, agricultural
practice, regulated by the Act Animals, and the Royal Decree on
Procedures. The Dutch Experiments on Animals Act does not apply to
non-experimental, agricultural practices. An ethical review by the
Statement Animal Experiment Committee was therefore not required. No
extra animal discomfort was caused for sample collection for the purpose
of this study' [@pbio.3000411.ref174].
