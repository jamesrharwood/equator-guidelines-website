## What to write

For each analysis, report the exact value of *n* in each
experimental group.

## Explanation

The exact number of experimental units analysed in each
group (i.e., the *n* number) is essential information for the reader to
interpret the analysis; it should be reported unambiguously. All animals
and data used in the experiment should be accounted for in the data
presented. Sometimes, for good reasons, animals may need to be excluded
from a study (e.g., illness or mortality), or data points excluded from
analyses (e.g., biologically implausible values). Reporting losses will
help the reader to understand the experimental design process, replicate
methods, and provide adequate tracking of animal numbers in a study,
especially when sample size numbers in the analyses do not match the
original group numbers.

For each outcome measure, indicate numbers clearly within the text or on
figures and provide absolute numbers (e.g., 10/20, not 50%). For studies
in which animals are measured at different time points, explicitly
report the full description of which animals undergo measurement and
when [@pbio.3000411.ref033].

## Examples

> 'Group F contained 29 adult males and 58 adult females in 2010 (*n* =
87), and 32 adult males and 66 adult females in 2011 (*n* = 98). The
increase in female numbers was due to maturation of juveniles to adults.
Females belonged to three matrilines, and there were no major shifts in
rank in the male hierarchy. Six mid to low ranking individuals died and
were excluded from analyses, as were five mid-ranking males who
emigrated from the group at the beginning of 2011'
[@pbio.3000411.ref060].

> 'The proportion of test time that animals spent interacting with the
handler (sniffed the gloved hand or tunnel, made paw contact, climbed
on, or entered the handling tunnel) was measured from DVD recordings.
This was then averaged across the two mice in each cage as they were
tested together and their behaviour was not independent.... Mice handled
with the home cage tunnel spent a much greater proportion of the test
interacting with the handler (mean ± s.e.m., 39.8 ± 5.2 percent time of
60 s test, n = 8 cages) than those handled by tail (6.4 ± 2.0 percent
time, n = 8 cages), while those handled by cupping showed intermediate
levels of voluntary interaction (27.6 ± 7.1 percent time, n = 8 cages)'
[@pbio.3000411.ref061].
