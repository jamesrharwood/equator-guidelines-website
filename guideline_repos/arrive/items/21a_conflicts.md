## What to write

Declare any potential conflicts of interest, including
financial and nonfinancial. If none exist, this should be stated.

## Explanation

A competing or conflict of interest is anything that
interferes with (or could be perceived as interfering with) the full and
objective presentation, analysis, and interpretation of the research.
Competing or conflicts of interest can be financial or nonfinancial,
professional or personal. They can exist in institutions, in teams, or
with individuals. Potential competing interests are considered in peer
review, editorial, and publication decisions; the aim is to ensure
transparency, and in most cases, a declaration of a conflict of interest
does not obstruct the publication or review process.

Examples are provided below. If unsure, declare all
potential conflicts, including both perceived and real conflicts of
interest [@pbio.3000411.ref254].

## Examples of competing or conflicts of interest

arising from the publication of the study, or funding or other payments

### Personal

people who may potentially benefit financially or in other ways from the
research.
