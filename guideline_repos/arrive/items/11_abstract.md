## What to write

Provide an accurate summary of the research objectives, animal species, strain and sex, key methods, principal findings, and study conclusions.

## Explanation

A transparent and accurate abstract increases the
utility and impact of the manuscript and allows readers to assess the
reliability of the study [@pbio.3000411.ref153]. The abstract is
often used as a screening tool by readers to decide whether to read the
full article or whether to select an article for inclusion in a
systematic review. However, abstracts often either do not contain enough
information for this purpose [@pbio.3000411.ref011] or contain
information that is inconsistent with the results in the rest of the
manuscript [@pbio.3000411.ref154; @pbio.3000411.ref155]. In
systematic reviews, initial screens to identify papers are based on
titles, abstracts, and keywords [@pbio.3000411.ref156]. Leaving out
of the abstract information such as the species of animal used or the
drugs being tested limits the value of preclinical systematic reviews as
relevant studies cannot be identified and included. For example, in a
systematic review of the effect of the MVA85A vaccine on tuberculosis
challenge in animals, the largest preclinical trial did not include the
vaccine name in the abstract or keywords of the publication; the paper
was only included in the systematic review following discussions with
experts in the field [@pbio.3000411.ref157].

To maximise utility, include details of the species, sex, and strain of
animals used and accurately report the methods, results, and conclusions
of the study. Also describe the objectives of the study, including
whether it was designed either to test a specific hypothesis or to
generate a new hypothesis (see Item 13. Objectives). Incorporating this
information will enable readers to interpret the strength of evidence
and judge how the study fits within the wider knowledge base.

## Examples

> 'Background and Purpose
>
> 'Asthma is an inflammatory disease that involves airway
hyperresponsiveness and remodelling. Flavonoids have been associated to
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and may represent a
potential therapeutic treatment of asthma. Our aim was to evaluate the
effects of the sakuranetin treatment in several aspects of experimental
asthma model in mice.
>
> 'Experimental Approach
>
> 'Male BALB/c mice received ovalbumin (i.p.) on days 0 and 14, and were
challenged with aerolized ovalbumin 1% on days 24, 26 and 28.
Ovalbumin-sensitized animals received vehicle (saline and dimethyl
sulfoxide, DMSO), sakuranetin (20 mg kg^--1^ per mice) or dexamethasone
(5 mg kg^--1^ per mice) daily beginning from 24th to 29th day. Control
group received saline inhalation and nasal drop vehicle. On day 29, we
determined the airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodelling
as well as specific IgE antibody. RANTES, IL- 5, IL -4, Eotaxin, IL -10,
TNF -α, IFN -γ and GMC-SF content in lung homogenate was performed by
Bioplex assay, and 8-isoprostane and NF -kB activations were visualized
in inflammatory cells by immunohistochemistry.
>
> 'Key Results
>
> 'We have demonstrated that sakuranetin treatment attenuated airway
hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and remodelling; and these effects
could be attributed to Th2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative
stress reduction as well as control of NF -kB activation.
>
> 'Conclusions and Implications
>
> 'These results highlighted the importance of counteracting oxidative
stress by flavonoids in this asthma model and suggest sakuranetin as a
potential candidate for studies of treatment of asthma'
[@pbio.3000411.ref158].

> 'In some parts of the world, the laboratory pig (Sus scrofa) is often
housed in individual, sterile housing which may impose stress. Our
objectives were to determine the effects of isolation and enrichment on
pigs housed within the PigTurn^®^---a novel penning system with
automated blood sampling---and to investigate tear staining as a novel
welfare indicator. Twenty Yorkshire × Landrace weaner pigs were randomly
assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial combination of
enrichment (non-enriched NE or enriched E) and isolation
(visually isolated I or able to see another pig NI). Pigs were
catheterised and placed into the PigTurns^®^ 48 h post recovery. Blood
was collected automatically twice daily to determine white blood cell
(WBC) differential counts and assayed for cortisol. Photographs of the
eyes were taken daily and tear staining was quantified using a 0--5
scoring scale and Image-J software to measure stain area and perimeter.
Behaviour was video recorded and scan sampled to determine time budgets.
Data were analysed as an REML using the MIXED procedure of SAS.
Enrichment tended to increase proportion of time standing and lying
laterally and decrease plasma cortisol, tear-stain area and perimeter.
There was a significant isolation by enrichment interaction. Enrichment
given to pigs housed in isolation had no effect on plasma cortisol, but
greatly reduced it in non-isolated pigs. Tear-staining area and
perimeter were highest in the NE-I treatment compared to the other three
treatments. Eosinophil count was highest in the E-NI treatment and
lowest in the NE-I treatment. The results suggest that in the absence of
enrichment, being able to see another animal but not interact may be
frustrating. The combination of no enrichment and isolation maximally
impacted tear staining and eosinophil numbers. However, appropriate
enrichment coupled with proximity of another pig would appear to improve
welfare' [@pbio.3000411.ref159].
