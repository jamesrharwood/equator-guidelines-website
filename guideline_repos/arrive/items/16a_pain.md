## What to write

Describe any interventions or steps taken in the experimental
protocols to reduce pain, suffering, and distress.

## Explanation

A safe and effective analgesic plan is critical to
relieve pain, suffering, and distress. Untreated pain can affect the
animals' biology and add variability to the experiment; however,
specific pain management procedures can also introduce variability,
affecting experimental data
[@pbio.3000411.ref212; @pbio.3000411.ref213]. Underreporting of
welfare management procedures contributes to the perpetuation of
noncompliant methodologies and insufficient or inappropriate use of
analgesia [@pbio.3000411.ref213] or other welfare measures. A
thorough description of the procedures used to alleviate pain,
suffering, and distress provides practical information for researchers
to replicate the method.

Clearly describe pain management strategies, including

- specific analgesic
- administration method (e.g., formulation, route, dose, concentration, volume, frequency, timing, and equipment used)
- rationale for the choice (e.g., animal model, disease/pathology, procedure, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, personnel safety)
- protocol modifications to reduce pain, suffering, and distress (e.g., changes to the anaesthetic protocol, increased frequency of monitoring, procedural modifications, habituation, etc.)

If analgesics or other welfare measures, reasonably expected for the
procedure performed, are not performed for experimental reasons, report
the scientific justification [@pbio.3000411.ref214].

## Examples

> 'If piglets developed diarrhea, they were placed on an electrolyte
solution and provided supplemental water, and if the diarrhea did not
resolve within 48 h, piglets received a single dose of ceftiofur (5.0 mg
ceftiofur equivalent/kg of body weight i.m Excede, Zoetis, Florham
Park, NJ). If fluid loss continued after treatment, piglets then
received a single dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral
suspension (50 mg/8 mg per mL, Hi-Tech Pharmacal, Amityville, NY) for 3
consecutive days' [@pbio.3000411.ref215].

> 'One hour before surgery, we administered analgesia to the mice by
offering them nut paste (Nutella; Ferrero, Pino Torinese, Italy)
containing 1 mg per kg body weight buprenorphine (Temgesic;
Schering-Plough Europe, Brussels, Belgium) for voluntary ingestion, as
described previously.... The mice had been habituated to pure nut paste
for 2 d prior to surgery' [@pbio.3000411.ref216].

> 'If a GCPS score equal or greater than 6 (out of 24) was assigned
postoperatively, additional analgesia was provided with methadone 0.1 mg
kg^âˆ’1^ IM (or IV if required) ... and pain reassessed 30 minutes later.
The number of methadone doses was recorded' [@pbio.3000411.ref046].
