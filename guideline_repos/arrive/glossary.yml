'animal research': "When ARRIVE refers to animal research it is referring to _in vivo_ animal research. This is the use of non-human animals, sometimes known as model organisms, in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Animal research varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied animal research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research, and toxicology.\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing)"
